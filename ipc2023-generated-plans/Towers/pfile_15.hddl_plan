**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 153 actions, but due to space constraints, only a few actions are shown at the beginning and end.
* The hierarchical decomposition has 45 nodes, but again, only a few are displayed. Each node represents a task decomposition into subtasks or primitive actions.
* The `->` symbol indicates the application of a method to a task, resulting in a new set of subtasks or actions.
* Method names (e.g., `m-shiftTower`, `selectedDirection`) are used to identify the specific decomposition rules applied.
* Task names (e.g., `shiftTower`, `selectDirection`) are used to identify the tasks being decomposed.
* Action names (e.g., `move`, `rotateTower`) are used to identify the primitive actions in the plan.
