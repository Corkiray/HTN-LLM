**Note:**

* The sequential plan is truncated due to its length, but it represents the series of actions required to solve the problem.
* The hierarchical decomposition shows how each task is broken down into subtasks, with the `root` task being `shiftTower t1 t2 t3`.
* The numbers in the decomposition refer to the task IDs in the sequential plan.
* Some tasks, like `move_abstract`, are further decomposed using methods like `newMethod21`, which ultimately lead to `move` actions.
* The `exchange` tasks are decomposed based on the ring sizes, using either `exchangeLR` or `exchangeRL` methods.
