To solve the given HTN problem, we first identify the initial state and the goal state. The initial state includes the smaller relationships between rings and towers, the current position of rings on other rings or towers, and the tower top definitions. The goal is to have all rings stacked in order of size on tower t3.

The problem starts with a task to shift a tower (t1) to another tower (t3) using a third tower (t2) as a temporary storage. Given the initial state and the goal, we can generate a plan that solves the problem step by step.

Here is the hierarchical plan to solve the given problem:

==>
1 selectDirection r5 t1 t2 t3
2 rotateTower t1 t3 t2
3 selectDirection r4 t1 t2 t3
4 rotateTower t1 t3 t2
5 selectDirection r3 t1 t2 t3
6 rotateTower t1 t3 t2
7 selectDirection r2 t1 t2 t3
8 rotateTower t1 t3 t2
9 selectDirection r1 t1 t2 t3
10 rotateTower t1 t3 t2
root 0
0 shiftTower t1 t2 t3 -> m-shiftTower r5 t1 t2 t3 1 2
11 move_abstract t1 t3 -> newMethod21 r5 t1 t1 t3 11
12 exchange t1 t2 t3 -> exchangeLR r5 t1 t1 t2 t3 12 13
13 rotateTower t2 t3 t1 -> m-rotateTower t2 t3 t1 14 15
14 move_abstract t2 t3 -> newMethod21 r5 t2 t2 t3 14
15 exchange t2 t3 t1 -> exchangeClear t2 t3 t1 15
16 selectDirection r4 t2 t1 t3 -> m-selectDirection r5 r4 t2 t1 t3 16 17
17 rotateTower t2 t1 t3 -> m-rotateTower t2 t1 t3 18 19
18 move_abstract t2 t1 -> newMethod21 r5 t2 t2 t1 18
19 exchange t2 t1 t3 -> exchangeRL t1 r4 t2 t3 t1 19 20
20 move_abstract t3 t2 -> newMethod21 r4 t3 t3 t2 20
21 rotateTower t1 t3 t2 -> m-rotateTower t1 t3 t2 22 23
22 move_abstract t1 t3 -> newMethod21 r4 t1 t1 t3 22
23 exchange t1 t3 t2 -> exchangeClear t1 t3 t2 23
<==

This plan outlines the steps to achieve the goal, starting with selecting a direction for moving the rings and then performing a series of rotations and exchanges to place the rings in the correct order on tower t3. It's a simplified representation and assumes that the planner can handle the details of each task, like the `newMethod21` and the `m-shiftTower` method, which decompose tasks into more specific actions or other tasks.

Note that this plan is an abstract representation and might need further refinement depending on the specific requirements of the planner or domain. Additionally, the actions within each method or task might be interleaved differently based on the domain's specifics, the planner's strategy, and the nuances of handling goal and tower operations.
