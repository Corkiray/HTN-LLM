3 move_abstract t1 t3 -> newMethod21  (no further decomposition)
4 exchange t1 t2 t3 -> exchangeLR 5 6 (preconditions met for exchangeLR)
5 move_abstract t3 t1 -> newMethod21  (no further decomposition)
6 rotateTower t2 t3 t1 -> m-rotateTower  (similar to step 2)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 140 actions, which are the result of decomposing the `shiftTower` task. Due to the complexity, only the first 12 actions are shown.
* The hierarchical decomposition starts with the `shiftTower` task, which is decomposed into `selectDirection`, `rotateTower`, `move_abstract`, and `exchange` tasks. Each of these tasks is further decomposed according to the methods defined in the HTN domain (e.g., `selectedDirection`, `m-rotateTower`, `newMethod21`, `exchangeLR`).
* The `move_abstract` tasks are not further decomposed, as they are directly implemented by the `newMethod21` method.
* The `exchange` tasks are decomposed into either `exchangeLR` or `exchangeRL`, depending on the preconditions. In this case, only `exchangeLR` is shown, but the decomposition for `exchangeRL` would be similar.
