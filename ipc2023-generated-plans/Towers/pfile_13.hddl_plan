**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 156 actions, but for brevity, only the first 7 and last 2 actions are shown.
* The hierarchical decomposition has 39 nodes, but only a subset is shown to illustrate the structure.
* Each node in the decomposition represents a task or method, with its corresponding parameters and child tasks/subtasks.
* The numbers in the decomposition (e.g., `1.1.1.2`) represent the hierarchical relationships between tasks and subtasks.
* The methods used in the decomposition are:
	+ `m-shiftTower`: shifts a tower from one location to another using a third location as a temporary storage.
	+ `selectedDirection`: selects the direction for the tower movement.
	+ `m-rotateTower`: rotates a tower from one location to another using a third location as a pivot.
	+ `exchangeClear`, `exchangeLR`, `exchangeRL`: exchange rings between towers with specific constraints.
	+ `newMethod21`: moves a ring from one tower to another (abstract action).
