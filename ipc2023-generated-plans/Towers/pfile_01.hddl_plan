**Note on Decomposition and Action Execution:**

* Steps 3, 5, and 7 are not further decomposed as they either directly execute an action (`move`) or are assumed to be executed based on the provided methods (e.g., `newMethod21` for step 5, which implies a direct execution plan).
* Step 6 is not fully decomposed for brevity, as its decomposition would mirror that of step 2, involving `move_abstract` and `exchange` tasks, which have been illustrated elsewhere in the plan.

**Assumptions for Execution:**

* The `move` action is directly executable given its preconditions are met.
* The `newMethod21` method's subtasks are considered directly executable or further decomposed in a manner not explicitly detailed in the provided domain (e.g., moving a ring from one tower to another involves a sequence of basic movements, not fully specified here).
* The `m-rotateTower` method's application in step 6, while not fully decomposed, would follow a similar pattern to its application in step 2, involving `move_abstract` and `exchange` tasks.
