To solve the given HTN problem, we need to follow the hierarchical decomposition of tasks according to the methods provided in the domain definition. We start with the task `(shiftTower t1 t2 t3)` and apply the relevant methods to decompose it into more primitive tasks or actions until we reach the action level, which in this case is the `move` action.

Given the initial state and goal, the plan will involve moving the ring `r1` from tower `t1` to tower `t3`, using tower `t2` as an intermediate tower if necessary. The key steps involve selecting a direction for the move (which involves selecting how to use the intermediate tower), rotating the tower (which involves abstract moves and exchanges), and finally executing the move.

However, to give a precise plan as requested, we'll follow the structure provided in the example output format, adapting it to the specific tasks and actions derived from the problem and domain definitions.

First, we identify that the task `(shiftTower t1 t2 t3)` needs to be decomposed. According to the method `m-shiftTower`, this involves the task `(selectDirection ?r ?t1 ?t2 ?t3)`, where `?r` is `r1`, `?t1` is `t1`, `?t2` is `t2`, and `?t3` is `t3`.

Given the state, `r1` is on `t1`, and we aim to move it to `t3`. The method `selectedDirection` further decomposes `(selectDirection ?r ?t1 ?t2 ?t3)` into `(rotateTower ?t1 ?t3 ?t2)`, indicating the direction of movement involves rotating the towers.

The method `m-rotateTower` decomposes `(rotateTower ?t1 ?t2 ?t3)` into `(move_abstract ?t1 ?t2)` followed by `(exchange ?t1 ?t2 ?t3)`. However, for our specific case, since we're focusing on moving `r1` from `t1` to `t3` and the towers' tops and the ring's position, the `exchange` method relevant here is `exchangeLR` or `exchangeRL`, depending on the specifics of the ring and tower sizes and positions.

Given `r1` is smaller than all towers and is initially on `t1`, and our goal is to get it to `t3`, we'll need to use an `exchange` method that fits our scenario. However, the exact sequence of moves (whether `exchangeLR` or `exchangeRL`) depends on how we interpret the rotation and movement of towers given the initial state and goal.

Since our initial state has `r1` on `t1`, `t2` and `t3` are free, and we aim for `r1` to be on `t3`, let's break it down into more concrete steps based on the actions and methods provided:

1. **Move Abstract**: This step involves moving `r1` from `t1` to `t2` as an abstract step, preparing for the exchange.
2. **Exchange**: Then, we perform an exchange that involves moving `r1` from `t2` to `t3`. This might involve rotating towers or direct moves based on the method used.

Given these steps, the sequence might look something like this:

==>
1. move_abstract t1 t2
2. move_abstract t2 t3
3. exchange t1 t2 t3
However, these steps need to be refined based on the actual methods and actions defined in the domain, especially considering the ring's movement and tower rotation.

The `move` action, being the most primitive, would be the final step in our decomposition, involving moving `r1` from one tower to another, considering the preconditions (like `r1` being on top of `t1` and smaller than the top of the destination tower).

Thus, refining the above sequence with the actual actions and considering the goal of moving `r1` to `t3`:

==>
1. move r1 t1 t2 t3
However, this simplification doesn't fully respect the hierarchical decomposition and the specific methods provided for each task.

To accurately solve the problem and provide a hierarchical plan, we must consider each method's preconditions and effects, ensuring that each step is valid given the current state. The precise sequence will depend on applying the methods correctly, from `shiftTower` down to `move`, considering the ring's size, its initial position on `t1`, and the goal position on `t3`.

Let's attempt a more detailed decomposition following the domain's methods:

- `(shiftTower t1 t2 t3)` decomposes into `(selectDirection r1 t1 t2 t3)`
- `(selectDirection r1 t1 t2 t3)` could involve `(rotateTower t1 t3 t2)` based on `selectedDirection`
- `(rotateTower t1 t3 t2)` decomposes into `(move_abstract t1 t2)` and `(exchange t1 t2 t3)` by `m-rotateTower`
- For `(exchange t1 t2 t3)`, considering `r1`'s size and position, we might use `exchangeLR` or `exchangeRL`, involving further moves or rotations.

Given these complexities and the need for a precise, step-by-step decomposition respecting the domain's methods and the problem's specifics, the plan will involve several steps of selecting directions, rotating towers, and finally moving the ring.

==>
1. selectDirection r1 t1 t2 t3
2. rotateTower t1 t3 t2
3. move_abstract t1 t2
4. exchange t1 t2 t3
Given the specifics of `exchange`, this might further decompose into more detailed moves or rotations.

Note that the provided plan and decomposition are attempts to follow the structure and methods given in the domain and problem definitions. The exact sequence of actions and tasks might vary depending on a deeper analysis of the preconditions, effects, and the specific methods' applicability to the given initial state and goal.
