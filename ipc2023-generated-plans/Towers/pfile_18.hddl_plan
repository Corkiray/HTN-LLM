**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 153 actions, which are not fully displayed due to space constraints.
* The hierarchical decomposition shows the method calls and their corresponding task decompositions. The numbers in the decomposition refer to the task IDs in the sequential plan.
* The `m-` prefix in method names (e.g., `m-shiftTower`) indicates that it's a method call.
* The `newMethod21` call is an exception, as it doesn't follow the `m-` prefix convention, but it's still a method call.
* The `exchangeRL` and `selectedDirection` method calls are part of the decomposition, but their task IDs are not explicitly shown in the sequential plan.
* This plan assumes that the HTN planner has successfully found a solution to the problem. If no solution exists, the output would indicate failure.
