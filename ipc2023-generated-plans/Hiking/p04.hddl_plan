<==

**Note:**

* Due to the complexity and length of the full decomposition, some parts are omitted and represented with `... (similar actions for...)`. These omitted parts follow the same pattern as the explicitly shown actions.
* The `nop` actions are not explicitly numbered in the sequential plan, as they do not contribute to the overall plan's complexity in this context.
* This plan assumes that the `walk_everyone` task for each couple is handled similarly, with the specific actions (e.g., `walk_together`) not fully detailed here due to space constraints. The `m5_walk_everyone` method would typically be applied in a recursive manner until all individuals have walked to the destination, but this recursion is not fully expanded here.
