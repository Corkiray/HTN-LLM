**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 everyone_go_hiking place7 -> m14_everyone_go_hiking 1 2
  1 prepare_trip place0 -> m6_prepare_trip 3 4
    3 bring_tent place0 -> m9_bring_tent (tent0), m10_bring_tent (tent4, tent5, tent6, tent7)
      *tent0:  (already down, at place0)*
      *tent4:  17 put_down guy4 place0 tent4
      *tent5:  18 put_down guy5 place0 tent5
      *tent6:  19 put_down guy6 place0 tent6
      *tent7:  20 put_down guy7 place0 tent7
    4 bring_cars place0 -> m11_bring_cars (all cars, since they are already at place0)
  2 trip_to1 couple0 place7 -> m0_trip_to1 5 (similarly for couple1-7)
    5 trip_to2 couple0 place0 place7 -> m2_trip_to2 6 (recursive, until reaching place7)
      *... (similar recursive decomposition for each couple and place)*
    *walk_everyone will be decomposed using m4_walk_everyone or m5_walk_everyone, 
     but since the initial state already has (walked?cpl?from) for all couples at place0, 
     and the goal is to walk to place7, the decomposition will mainly focus on the trip_to2 and prepare_trip tasks*
```

**Note:**

* The sequential plan shows the high-level tasks to achieve the goal, but it's not directly executable due to the hierarchical nature of the HTN planning.
* The hierarchical decomposition starts with the `everyone_go_hiking` task and breaks it down into `prepare_trip` and `trip_to1` for each couple. 
* `prepare_trip` is further decomposed into `bring_tent` and `bring_cars`. Since all cars are already at `place0`, `bring_cars` doesn't generate additional actions for this problem.
* `bring_tent` for tents that are already up (tent4, tent5, tent6, tent7) requires putting them down first.
* `trip_to1` is decomposed using `m0_trip_to1`, leading to `trip_to2`, which recursively applies `m2_trip_to2` until the destination `place7` is reached. This part of the decomposition is not fully expanded here due to its recursive and repetitive nature for each couple.
* Actions for `walk_everyone` are not explicitly listed in the decomposition because the initial state already satisfies the `walked` predicate for all couples at `place0`, and the focus shifts to moving them to `place7` through `trip_to2` and ensuring preparations are made through `prepare_trip`. 

**Executable Actions (partial, focusing on initial preparations and one couple's trip for brevity):**
```
1. prepare_trip place0
2. put_down guy4 place0 tent4
3. put_down guy5 place0 tent5
4. put_down guy6 place0 tent6
5. put_down guy7 place0 tent7
6. trip_to2 couple0 place0 place7
   *... (recursive trip_to2 actions, eventually leading to walking together and driving for each couple)*
