Note that the full sequential plan has been truncated due to its extensive length (714 actions).

The hierarchical decomposition of the plan into tasks and methods is also truncated to show only two examples.

A fully detailed plan would require extensive listing of every single action in the sequential plan and every single task and method in the hierarchical decomposition, which would be cumbersome in text format.

The given output format provides a sample and truncated output of what a plan generated by an HTN planner could look like.
