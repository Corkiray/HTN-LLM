```
==>
**Sequential Plan**
1 pickup o1 r2
2 move c r2 d24
3 pickup o4 r2
4 move r2 r4 d24
5 putdown o1 r4
6 putdown o4 r4
7 move r4 c d04
8 move c r3 d03
9 pickup o2 r3
10 move r3 r4 d03
11 putdown o2 r4
12 move r4 r1 d14
13 move r1 r4 d14
14 move r4 r2 d24
15 pickup o3 r4
16 putdown o3 r2
17 move r2 r4 d24
18 move r4 r2 d24
19 putdown o5 r2 (already in goal location, but included for completeness)
20 achieve-goals

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
root 0
0 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-pickup 1 2 3 4 5 (o1, r4)
  1 pickup_abstract o1 -> newMethod22 1 (o1, r2)
  2 move_abstract -> newMethod24 2 (c, r2, d24)
  3 pickup_abstract o4 -> newMethod22 3 (o4, r2)
  4 move_abstract -> newMethod24 4 (r2, r4, d24)
  5 putdown_abstract -> newMethod23 5 (o1, r4)

  6 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-pickup 7 8 9 10 11 (o2, r4)
    7 move_abstract -> newMethod24 7 (r4, c, d04)
    8 move_abstract -> newMethod24 8 (c, r3, d03)
    9 pickup_abstract o2 -> newMethod22 9 (o2, r3)
    10 move_abstract -> newMethod24 10 (r3, r4, d03)
    11 putdown_abstract -> newMethod23 11 (o2, r4)

    15 pickup_abstract o3 -> newMethod22 15 (o3, r4)
    16 putdown_abstract -> newMethod23 16 (o3, r2)

  17 achieve-goals -> finished 17 (all goals achieved)
    17 achieve-goals -> finished (no more tasks)

```
**Explanation:**

1. The sequential plan (actions 1-20) achieves the goal by:
	* Picking up `o1` and `o4` in `r2`, moving them to `r4`, and putting them down.
	* Picking up `o2` in `r3`, moving it to `r4`, and putting it down.
	* Moving `o3` from `r4` to `r2` and putting it down.
	* Noting that `o5` is already in its goal location `r2`.
2. The hierarchical decomposition:
	* Starts with the `achieve-goals` task (root 0).
	* Decomposes into three `achieve-goals-pickup` tasks for each package (`o1`, `o2`, `o3`).
	* Each `achieve-goals-pickup` task further decomposes into:
		+ `pickup_abstract` (using `newMethod22`) for the specific package.
		+ `move_abstract` (using `newMethod24`) to navigate to the package's location and then to the goal location.
		+ `putdown_abstract` (using `newMethod23`) to place the package in its goal location.
	* The final `achieve-goals` task decomposes into the `finished` method, indicating all goals have been achieved.
