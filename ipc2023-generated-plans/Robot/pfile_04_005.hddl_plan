Please note that this plan is based on the provided domain and problem, and the generated plan may not be optimal or unique. 

Additionally, to make the plan more understandable, here's a summary:

1. The plan starts with the `achieve-goals` task, which is decomposed into `achieve-goals-pickup` for `o1`, `o2`, `o3`, `o4`, and `o5`.
2. For each package, the plan involves picking it up, moving to the target room, and putting it down.
3. The `release-putdown_abstract` method is used to ensure that the package is released at the target room.
4. The `newMethod25` is used to open doors when necessary.
5. The plan involves multiple instances of `move`, `pickup`, and `putdown` actions, which are decomposed from the `newMethod24`, `newMethod22`, and `newMethod23` methods, respectively.

Note: This plan may require further modifications or refinements based on specific requirements or constraints not mentioned in the problem statement.
