To solve the given problem, we will decompose the tasks using the methods provided in the domain definition.

First, we will start with the initial task `(achieve-goals)`, which has no preconditions but aims to satisfy the goal conditions.

Since the goal is to have `o1` in `r3` and `o2` in `r2`, and both objects are currently in `r1`, we need to move them to their respective goal locations.

Let's start with `o1`. To move `o1` to `r3`, we first need to pick it up from `r1`, then move to `r3` through the door `d13`, which is currently closed. Thus, we need to open the door first.

For `o2`, we similarly need to pick it up from `r1` and then move to `r2` through the door `d12`, which is also closed. So, we need to open this door as well.

Here is the hierarchical plan:

==>
1 pickup o1 r1
2 open r1 r3 d13
3 move r1 r3 d13
4 putdown o1 r3
5 pickup o2 r1
6 open r1 r2 d12
7 move r1 r2 d12
8 putdown o2 r2
root 0
0 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-pickup 1 5
1 achieve-goals-pickup -> newMethod22 1
2 achieve-goals-move -> newMethod25 2
3 achieve-goals-move -> newMethod24 3
4 achieve-goals-pickup -> newMethod23 4
5 achieve-goals-pickup -> newMethod22 5
6 achieve-goals-open -> newMethod25 6
7 achieve-goals-move -> newMethod24 7
8 achieve-goals-pickup -> newMethod23 8
<==

This plan sequence first picks up `o1`, opens the door to `r3`, moves to `r3`, and puts down `o1`. Then, it picks up `o2`, opens the door to `r2`, moves to `r2`, and puts down `o2`, thus achieving the goal state.
