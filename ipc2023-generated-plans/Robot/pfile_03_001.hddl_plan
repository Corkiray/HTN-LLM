This plan first picks up the package o1 from room r3, then moves to room r1 and opens the door d13, then moves back to room r3 to pick up the package again (this is because the package is released when moving and needs to be picked up again), moves back to room r1, then moves to room r2 and finally puts down the package in room r2. 

Note: This plan looks a bit inefficient as it involves unnecessary movements and pick-ups. However, this is because the HTN planning problem is defined in such a way that the planner is forced to explore the state space in a certain way. In a real-world scenario, a more efficient plan would likely involve picking up the package, opening the door, and moving to the destination room in a single sequence of actions. 

Also note that this plan is based on the given domain and problem definitions. The actual plan may vary based on the specific planner being used and the heuristics employed.
