This plan first picks up package o2 from room r1, then opens the door between the current room c and room r2, moves to room r2, and finally puts down package o2 in room r2. 

Note: This plan assumes that the initial state of the robot is in room c and the initial state of the packages is as specified in the problem description. 

Also, the plan does not include any error handling or handling of unexpected events. In a real-world application, you would need to consider these factors as well. 

Please note that the output is based on the domain and problem definition provided and might not be the only possible solution. The planner used to generate this plan is assumed to be a HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planner.
