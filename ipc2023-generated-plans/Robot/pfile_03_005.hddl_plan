The explanation is as follows:
 
The plan starts with a pick_up task for package o4. This task is decomposed into method newMethod22 and later into an action pickup. But to accomplish it, the robot has to open the door between r2 and r1 and move to r1, put the package o4 in r1 and later repeat the operations for packages o3 in r1.

The initial state of the problem has the robot at location "c" (central location), the packages are spread around different rooms and the robot should leave the packages as specified in the goal description which is roughly the same as in the initial state, so it needs to move packages o3 and o4 to its corresponding locations, finally returning to the central location.
