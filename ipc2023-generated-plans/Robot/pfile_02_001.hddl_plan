This plan starts with opening the door between the current location `c` and room `r2` where the package `o1` is located, then moves to `r2` to pick up `o1`. After that, it moves back to `c` and then to `r1` where `o1` needs to be delivered, and finally puts down `o1` in `r1`. The `newMethod22`, `newMethod23`, `newMethod24`, and `newMethod25` are used to decompose the abstract tasks `pickup_abstract`, `putdown_abstract`, `move_abstract`, and `open_abstract` into the concrete actions `pickup`, `putdown`, `move`, and `open`, respectively. The `achieve-goals-pickup` method is used to decompose the `achieve-goals` task into a sequence of tasks that achieve the goal of delivering `o1` to `r1`.
