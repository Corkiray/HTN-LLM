This plan starts with the action "pickup o1 r1" to grab the package, then opens the door "d01" to move from room "c" to room "r1", then moves to room "r1", and finally puts down the package "o1" in room "r1". The goal is already satisfied in the initial state (the package is in room "r1"), so no additional actions are needed to achieve the goal.

Note: This plan assumes that the goal is to have the package in room "r1" and the robot achieves this goal by moving the package to room "r1" and then putting it down. However, since the package is already in room "r1" in the initial state, the plan could be simplified to just opening the door and moving to room "r1" to satisfy the goal. But this would require a different HTN method decomposition. 

Here is an alternative plan based on the given HTN domain:

==>
1 open c r1 d01
2 move c r1 d01
root 0
0 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-open 
1 open c r1 d01 -> newMethod25 c r1 d01
2 move c r1 d01 -> newMethod24 c r1 d01
<== 

This plan opens the door and moves to room "r1" to satisfy the goal. No pickup or putdown actions are needed since the package is already in the correct room.
