0 play -> do_play 1 
1 do_play -> 
  1.1 turn -> do_turn l0 l0 Y N
  1.2 play -> end_game (since the goal is achieved after the first turn)
2 do_turn l0 l0 Y N -> 
  2.1 flip l0 l0 Y N
  2.2 propagate_up l0 l0 Y
  2.3 propagate_down l0 l0 Y
  2.4 propagate_left l0 l0 Y
  2.5 propagate_right l0 l0 Y
3 propagate_up l0 l0 Y -> propagate_up_end_field l0 l0 Y (since (max l0))
4 propagate_down l0 l0 Y -> propagate_down_end_field l0 l0 Y (since (min l0))
5 propagate_left l0 l0 Y -> propagate_left_end_field l0 l0 Y (since (max l0) implies no left neighbor)
6 propagate_right l0 l0 Y -> propagate_right_end_field l0 l0 Y (since (min l0) implies no right neighbor)

Note:
- The plan only contains one action (`flip`) because the initial state and goal are very specific, and the `flip` action directly achieves the goal.
- The `do_turn` method is applied once, as it is the first subtask of `do_play`, and it already leads to achieving the goal.
- The propagation methods (`propagate_up`, `propagate_down`, `propagate_left`, `propagate_right`) all end immediately because the problem's initial state specifies `l0` as both the maximum and minimum coordinate, implying there are no adjacent coordinates to propagate to.
