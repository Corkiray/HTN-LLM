2 propagate_up l1 l1 Y -> propagate_up_do l1 l1 l2 Y N 6
3 propagate_down l1 l1 Y -> propagate_down_do l1 l1 l0 Y N (no further decomposition, as it's at the min boundary)
4 propagate_left l1 l1 Y -> propagate_left_end_different l1 l1 l0 Y (no further decomposition, as the adjacent cell is different)

14 propagate_right l3 l2 N -> propagate_right_end_field l3 l2 N (no further decomposition, as it's at the max boundary)
15 play -> end_game (empty, as the game is considered ended after the last turn)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 14 `flip` actions, which are the only actions available in the domain.
* The hierarchical decomposition shows how the `play` task is decomposed into `turn` tasks, and how each `turn` task is further decomposed into `propagate_*` tasks. Some `propagate_*` tasks are decomposed further, while others are not, depending on the preconditions and boundaries.
* The decomposition assumes that the `next`, `max`, and `min` predicates are used to determine the boundaries and adjacent cells.
* The plan is not guaranteed to be optimal, as the HTN planning process can produce different plans depending on the search strategy and heuristics used.
