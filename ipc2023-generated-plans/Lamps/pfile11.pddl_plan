**Sequential Plan**
1. `flip l1 l1 N Y` (to satisfy `do_turn` precondition)
2. `turn l1 l1 Y N` (apply `do_turn` method)
3. `flip l2 l1 N Y` (propagate up from `l1 l1`)
4. `flip l3 l1 N Y` (propagate up from `l2 l1`)
5. `flip l3 l2 N Y` (propagate right from `l3 l1`)
6. `flip l2 l2 Y N` (to satisfy `do_turn` precondition)
7. `turn l2 l2 N Y` (apply `do_turn` method)
8. `flip l3 l2 Y N` (propagate down from `l2 l2`)
9. `flip l3 l3 Y N` (to satisfy `end_game` precondition)

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 play -> do_play 1 9
  1 turn l1 l1 Y N -> do_turn 2 3 4 5
    2 flip l1 l1 N Y
    3 propagate_up l1 l1 Y -> propagate_up_do 4
      4 flip l2 l1 N Y
      (propagate_up l2 l1 Y is not applicable, ends here)
    5 propagate_right l1 l1 Y -> propagate_right_do 6
      6 flip l3 l1 N Y
      (propagate_right l3 l1 Y is not applicable, ends here)
  7 turn l2 l2 Y N -> do_turn 8
    8 propagate_down l2 l2 Y -> propagate_down_do (not applicable, already at min)
  9 play -> end_game (no subtasks)
```

**Note:**

* The plan assumes that the `next` predicate is symmetric (i.e., if `(next l0 l1)` then `(next l1 l0)` is implied, although not explicitly stated). If this is not the case, the plan might need adjustments.
* The `propagate_*` methods are only applied when their preconditions are met, and they stop recursing when they reach the boundary (max/min) or encounter a different status.
* The `flip` actions are the only ones that modify the state, and they are only applied when the preconditions (different status and `on` predicate) are met.
* The plan achieves the goal state by flipping the necessary coordinates to match the desired `on` predicates.
