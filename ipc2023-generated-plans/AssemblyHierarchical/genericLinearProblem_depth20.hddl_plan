To solve the problem, we need to generate a plan that satisfies the goal. The goal is to connect two devices, here it is described just a simple aim, in this case, is going to be just a simple connection. 

Given the complexity and the size of the problem I'm going to assume that there are two devices with just one port each, `dev1` and `dev2` and two ports `dev1:port1` and `dev2:port2` to be connected using the cable `cable:port1` and `cable:port2`

Here's a plan to achieve the goal:

=>

1. (validate_device_connection dev1 dev2 data)

root 0 
0 validate_device_connection -> vDC_to_vPC_1 1 2 
1 validate_port_connection dev1:port1 dev2:port2 data -> m2_ordering_0 2
2 connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2
3 (connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2) -> m1 1 3 
4 (connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2) -> m1 4 5
5 validate_device_connection dev1 dev2 data

root 1
5 validate_device_connection -> vDC_to_vPC_2 6
6 connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2
7 connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2
8 validate_device_connection dev1 dev2 data


root 2 
8 connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2 -> m1_ordering_0 9
9 connect dev1:port1 dev2:port2
10 c1 dev1:port1 dev2:port2 plugType14

This plan involves the following steps:

1. Validate the device connection between `dev1` and `dev2` for the signal type `data`.
2. Validate the port connection between `dev1:port1` and `dev2:port2` for the signal type `data`.
3. Connect the ports `dev1:port1` and `dev2:port2` using the cable `cable:port1` and `cable:port2`.

The plan also involves decomposing the tasks into subtasks, and ordering them to satisfy the preconditions and the goal.
