Based on the given HTN Domain in `verkabelung.pddl`, here's a plan to solve it using the SHOP2 planner:

```
==> 
0 (pGuard)
1 (ValidateDeviceConnection p0 p1 data)
root 0
0 m3 -> ValidateDeviceConnection p0 p1 data
1 ConnectDevices p0 p1 data -> m1 Connect 2 3
2 ValidatePortConnection p0_2 p1_1 data -> vDC_to_vPC_1 ValidateDeviceConnection p0 p1 data
3 connect p0_2 p1_1
<==
```

This plan uses method `m3` to `ValidateDeviceConnection` and method `m1` to `ConnectDevices`. The `ValidatePortConnection` and `connect` tasks are part of the decomposition.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the plan:


- Task `ValidateDeviceConnection` is decomposed using `m3` method which validates the connection and decomposes `ValidatePortConnection`.


- Task `ConnectDevices` is decomposed using `m1` method which involves subtasks of connecting the ports and then connecting the devices.


- Task `ValidatePortConnection` is decomposed using `vDC_to_vPC_1` method which validates the connection between ports.


- The `connect` tasks involve physical connection of the ports which is the ultimate goal of the problem.


This is one of the possible plans to solve the problem using the given domain and methods. SHOP2 will provide a plan based on the methods and the current state of the problem.
