To generate a plan to solve this problem, I would use an HTN planner that can work with this domain definition. However, I will attempt to manually generate a plan based on the given domain definition.

Assuming the initial state of the problem is the one provided in the domain definition, we have 22 cables with different plug types, faces, and directions. We also have the goal of achieving (pAim).

Here's a possible plan to solve the problem:


==> 
1 aim


Since there is no method that can directly achieve the goal (pAim), we would use method m3 to ValidateDeviceConnection.


root 0
0 m3 ValidateDeviceConnection device1 device2 data -> m3_to_vDC_0 0


Method m3 decomposes into two subtasks: (guard) and ValidateDeviceConnection. ValidateDeviceConnection can be further decomposed using method vDC_to_vPC_1.


m3_to_vDC_0
0 vDC_to_vPC_1 ValidatePortConnection port1 port2 data -> vDC_to_vPC_1_to_ValidatePC_1 0


Method vDC_to_vPC_1 decomposes into ValidatePortConnection. However, we need to specify the ports for validation. Since we don't have any information about the ports being connected, we'll assume that port1 and port2 are part of device1 and device2 respectively.


vDC_to_vPC_1_to_ValidatePC_1
1 ValidatePortConnection port1 port2 data -> c1 connect port1 port2


ValidatePortConnection can be decomposed into the connect task using method c1. However, this plan is very general and may not cover all possible port combinations. In a real-world scenario, you would need to use more specialized methods or have more information about the ports being connected.


c1
connect port1 port2
