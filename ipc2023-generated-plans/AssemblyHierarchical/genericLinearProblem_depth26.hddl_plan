Based on the given HTN Domain, a possible hierarchical plan to solve the problem is:

==>
1 (guard)

This is the first step of the method m3 which checks if there is a guard condition fulfilled before proceeding.

root 0
0 ConnectDevices -> m3 1

This is the first method decomposition. It calls method m3 which in turn calls task (guard) and task (ValidateDeviceConnection ?d1 ?d2 ?t).

2 ValidateDeviceConnection d1 d2 data

This is the task that validates the connection between two devices d1 and d2 for a given signal type data.

root 0
0 ValidateDeviceConnection -> vDC_to_vPC_1 2

This is the second method decomposition. It calls method vDC_to_vPC_1 which in turn calls task (ValidatePortConnection ?p1 ?p2 ?t).

3 ValidatePortConnection p1 p2 data

This is the task that validates the connection between two ports p1 and p2 for a given signal type data.

root 1
1 ValidatePortConnection -> m1 3

This is the third method decomposition. It calls method m1 which in turn calls task (connect ?p1 ?p2).

4 connect p1 p2

This is the task that connects two ports p1 and p2.

root 2
2 connect -> c1 4

This is the fourth method decomposition. It calls method c1 which in turn calls task (connect_1 ?p1 ?p2 ?t).

5 connect_1 p1 p2 plugType20

This is the task that connects two ports p1 and p2 using a cable with plugType20.

Note that this is just one possible plan and there might be other plans depending on the specific conditions of the problem. Also, note that this plan only shows the decomposition of the method calls and does not include the actual execution of the tasks.
