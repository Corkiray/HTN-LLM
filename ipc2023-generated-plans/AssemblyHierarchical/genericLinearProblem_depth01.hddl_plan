Explanation:

- `Method m1` is chosen for the initial task `ConnectDevices pc printer data`.
  - The guard is set (`action guard` is executed).
  - `ValidateDeviceConnection pc printer data` is performed.
  - The method `vDC_to_vPC_1` is chosen for this task, since the ports in `pc` and `printer` have opposite directions and compatible signal sources and destinations.
  - This method calls `ValidatePortConnection cableWithPlugType1-a printer-aPlugType1 data` and `ValidatePortConnection cableWithPlugType1-b pc-bPlugType1 data`.
  - For the first `ValidatePortConnection`, method `vPC_to_vPC` is chosen, but it isn't directly applicable, since the cable port isn't already connected.
  - For the second `ValidatePortConnection`, the same applies.
  - Since there are no more methods for `ValidatePortConnection`, we move on to the final task `ok`. But first, we have to fulfill its precondition `pGuard`, which is already set.
  - The two ports are connected using methods `c3` and `c8`, respectively, but they aren't directly executed. Their associated actions are `connect_3` and `connect_8`, which will only be executed after the `pAim` has been reached in the plan.
  - The action `ok` is executed.
  - Finally, the plan includes the two `connect` actions.

This hierarchical plan describes the solution to the HTN problem.
