Given the complexity of the problem and the description of the domain provided, here is a step-by-step plan of possible actions that needs to be taken:


1 validateDeviceConnection d1 d2 data
2 validatePortConnection p1 p2 data
3 guard
4 connect p1 p2

root 0
0 ConnectDevices d1 d2 data -> m1_GoOrdering 1 2 3 4
  4.1 ValidatePortConnection p1 p2 data -> c1 5 
    5 connect_1 p1 p2 plugType18
  4.2 ValidatePortConnection p2 p3 data -> c2 6 
    6 connect_2 p2 p3 plugType18

**Note:** This plan is based on a hypothetical scenario using the given domain description, since no initial state or problem definition is provided. Also, due to the large number of possible sub-methods and the high degree of complexity in the provided plan, many of the details are ignored for brevity.
