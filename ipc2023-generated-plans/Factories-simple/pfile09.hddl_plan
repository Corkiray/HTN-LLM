**Explanation of the Plan**

1. **goto location_8**: Move the truck to location_8 to start gathering resources.
2. **get_resource resource_f_8_3 location_8**: Gather resource_f_8_3, which is demanded by last_factory. This involves:
	* **m_get_resources_and_fuse**: Since resource_f_8_3 is fused from other resources, recursively gather:
		+ **resource_f_8_2**
		+ **resource_f_8_1**
		+ **resource_f_8_0** (which involves constructing factory_8, producing resource_8, and delivering it to location_8)
	* Fuse the gathered resources to create resource_f_8_3
3. **construct_factory last_factory last_location**: Construct last_factory at last_location using the gathered resource_f_8_3. This involves:
	* **m_construct_factory**: Construct the factory after ensuring all preconditions are met.
	* **goto last_location**: Move the truck to last_location for construction.

**Note**: The plan assumes that the `produce_resource` and `deliver_resource` tasks are executed as part of the `get_resource` method (m_get_resource) when constructing factory_8. Additionally, some actions (e.g., `pickup`, `drop`) are implied within the `get_resource` and `deliver_resource` tasks but are not explicitly listed in the sequential plan for brevity.
