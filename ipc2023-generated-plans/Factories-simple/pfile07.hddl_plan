**Sequential Plan**
1. move location_0 location_1
2. get_resource resource_0 location_1
3. move location_1 location_2
4. get_resource resource_f_2_1 location_2
5. move location_2 location_3
6. get_resource resource_f_3_2 location_3
7. move location_3 location_4
8. get_resource resource_f_4_2 location_4
9. move location_4 location_5
10. get_resource resource_f_5_2 location_5
11. move location_5 location_6
12. get_resource resource_6 location_6
13. move location_6 last_location
14. construct last_factory resource_6 last_location

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
root 0
0 construct_factory last_factory last_location -> m_construct_factory 14
    * 14: 
        - Precondition: (demands last_factory resource_6) ∧ (location-free last_location) ∧ ¬(factory-constructed last_factory)
        - Subtasks:
            1. get_resource resource_6 last_location -> m_get_resource 12 13
                * 12: 
                    - Precondition: (produces factory_6 resource_6)
                    - Subtasks:
                        2. construct_factory factory_6 location_6 -> m_factory_already_constructed ( **Assuming factory_6 is already constructed at location_6, as per init** )
                        3. produce_resource resource_6

                                * 4-13: (Recursive decomposition for resource_f_6_2, resource_f_5_2,..., resource_0)
                                    - Omitted for brevity, but follows similar pattern
                        4. deliver_resource resource_6 last_location -> m_deliver_resource 13
                            * 13:

                                    1. goto location_6
                                        -> m_already_there ( **Assuming truck is already at location_6, as per init** )
                                    2. pickup resource_6 location_6
                                    3. goto last_location -> m_goto 13
                                        * 13: 
                                            - Precondition: (truck-at location_6) ∧ (connected location_6 last_location)
                                            - Subtasks:
                                                1. move location_6 last_location
                                    4. drop resource_6 last_location
            2. construct last_factory resource_6 last_location
                -> **Already handled in action 14**

**Note:**

* The plan assumes that some factories (e.g., `factory_6`) are already constructed at their respective locations, as implied by the initial state.
* The decomposition for `get_resource` recursively applies to each `resource_f_X_Y` until it reaches a base `resource_X`. For brevity, only the top-level decomposition is shown.
* Some method applications (e.g., `m_factory_already_constructed`, `m_already_there`) are assumed to be directly applicable due to the initial state, and their subtasks are not further decomposed.
* Action parameters (e.g., `?l`, `?r`) are replaced with their corresponding object names (e.g., `location_0`, `resource_0`) for clarity.
