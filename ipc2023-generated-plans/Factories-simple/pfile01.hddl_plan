**Note:**
- The plan assumes that the `construct` action for `factory_1` at `location_1` is implicitly handled within the `m_construct_factory` method, as the initial problem statement does not explicitly provide a method for constructing a factory that is not initially at the desired location but can be constructed there. The plan focuses on the resource gathering and delivery aspects.
- Actions like `pickup` and `drop` for `resource_1` at `last_location` (steps 8 and 9) seem redundant given the final delivery step (step 35) already achieves the desired state. These have been left in to maintain the sequential plan's integrity as derived from the hierarchical decomposition but can be optimized out in a practical implementation.
- The plan's complexity and the number of steps can be optimized further by directly applying the most relevant methods and actions based on the problem's initial state and goals, potentially bypassing some of the intermediate steps shown here. This response aims to illustrate the hierarchical decomposition process based on the provided HTN domain and problem.
