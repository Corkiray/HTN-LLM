**Sequential Plan:**

1. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ12` `POS2`
2. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ53` `APT2`
3. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ51` `POS4`
4. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ11` `POS1`
5. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ23` `APT1`
6. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ13` `POS5`
7. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ52` `APT4`
8. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ42` `POS3`
9. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ22` `POS1`
10. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ33` `APT4`
11. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ21` `APT2`
12. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ41` `POS4`
13. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ31` `POS3`

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

`root` `0`
`0` `ACHIEVE-AT-TASKS` -> `m1` `2` `3`... `24`
  * `m1` `ACHIEVE-AT` `OBJ12` `POS2` -> `m10` `1`
    + `m10` `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ12` `POS2` -> `M14` `4` `1`
      - `M14` `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU2` `POS2` (precond: `(IN OBJ12 TRU2)` - **FAIL**, no truck for OBJ12 at POS1, **REPLAN**)
      - **Replan:** `M12` `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS1` (precond: `(AT OBJ12 POS1)` - **OK**)
        * `M12` `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS1` -> `M4` `5` `6` `7`
          * `M4` `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK` `TRU1` `POS1` -> `M35` `8`
            * `M35` (no-op, already at POS1)
          * `LOAD-TRUCK` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS1` (precond: `(AT OBJ12 POS1)` - **OK**)
          * `i-UNLOCK-AT` `TRU1` `POS1` (precond: - **OK**)
        * `DRIVE-TRUCK` `TRU1` `POS1` `POS2` `CIT2` (precond: `(AT TRU1 POS1)` - **OK**)
        * `M14` `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS2` -> `M6` `9` `10` `11`
          * `M6` `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK` `TRU1` `POS2` -> `M36` `12` `13` `14` `15` (precond: `(AT TRU1 POS2)` - **OK after DRIVE-TRUCK**)
            * `M36` `DRIVE-TRUCK` `TRU1` `POS2` `POS2` `CIT2` (no-op, already at POS2)
          * `UNLOAD-TRUCK` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS2` (precond: `(IN OBJ12 TRU1)` - **OK after LOAD-TRUCK and DRIVE-TRUCK**)
          * `i-UNLOCK-AT` `TRU1` `POS2` (precond: - **OK**)
  *... (similar decomposition for other tasks, omitted for brevity)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan only shows the final locking actions for each object at its target location.
* The hierarchical decomposition focuses on the first task (`ACHIEVE-AT` `OBJ12` `POS2`) and its replanning due to the initial failure to meet the precondition for unloading from a truck.
* The `...` in the decomposition indicates where similar steps for other tasks have been omitted for brevity.
* Each method (e.g., `M12`, `M4`, `M35`) and action (e.g., `LOAD-TRUCK`, `DRIVE-TRUCK`) is only fully detailed once. Subsequent references are abbreviated.
* Preconditions are evaluated based on the initial state and the effects of previous actions in the plan.
