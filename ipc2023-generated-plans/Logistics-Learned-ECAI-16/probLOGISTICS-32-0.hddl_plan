**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 32 `i-LOCK-AT` actions to lock each object at its target location.
* The hierarchical decomposition is shown for the first task (`ACHIEVE-AT OBJ62 APT3`) and the last task (`ACHIEVE-AT OBJ102 POS11`). The decomposition for the remaining tasks is similar and omitted for brevity.
* Each task is decomposed into subtasks using the methods defined in the HTN domain (e.g., `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`, `M13-ACHIEVE-AT0`, etc.).
* The subtasks are further decomposed until primitive actions (e.g., `LOAD-AIRPLANE`, `LOAD-TRUCK`, `i-LOCK-AT`, etc.) are reached.
