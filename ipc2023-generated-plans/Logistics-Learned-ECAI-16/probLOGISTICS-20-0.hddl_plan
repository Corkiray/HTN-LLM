Here is an explanation of the plan. The plan starts with achieving specific locations for certain objects, like OBJ21 to APT4 (task 1). This is followed by a sequence of load and unload operations for objects like OBJ73 (tasks 7, 8), OBJ42 (tasks 12, 15, 16) and OBJ71 (tasks 31, 32). These operations need to be performed by vehicles like TRU5 and TRU7 (tasks 2, 6, 20). Once loaded or unloaded, objects need to be transported to specific places (tasks 3, 11, 24, 25, 29, 33). This is performed by vehicles like TRU5 and TRU7 and airplanes like APN2. 
In the `root 0`, and after each method it is indicated which other methods are called with their corresponding subtasks. 

For example, In `0 M15-DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0 -> m20_ordering_12 40 41 13 35 14 15 16 37`  we can see that this task calls two subtasks: m20_ordering_12. The numbers between represent which tasks are being called and the name m20_ordering_12 comes from: 
`m20_ordering` (the method used is `M20-DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0`  or similar, and for `ordering`: because usually, the previous term is followed of `ordering` and a number) ` `_12`: in this case `12`  would be the position of the subtask which is calling this task.
