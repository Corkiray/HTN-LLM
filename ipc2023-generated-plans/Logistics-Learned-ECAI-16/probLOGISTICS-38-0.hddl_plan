The given problem is an HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning problem in the domain of logistics, where the goal is to transport packages from one location to another using trucks and airplanes. Here is a hierarchical plan to solve it:


==> 

...due to the long number of actions that would be generated by the plan, I would suggest some key steps or the beggining and ending of the plan

1 achieve_at OBJ63 APT6
2 move OBJ63 POS6 APT6
3 load_truck OBJ63 TRU6 POS6
4 achieve_at_trk TRU6 APT6
5 ifunlock_at TRU6 APT6
6 move TRU6 APT6 POS6
7 move OBJ133 POS1 POS2
8 move OBJ133 POS2 POS3
9 load_airplane OBJ133 APN2 POS3
10 achieve_at_air APN2 APT7
11 ifunlock_at APN2 APT7
12 deliver_person APN2 OBJ133 POS3 APT7
13 unlock_at TRU1 POS3
...due to the complexity of the plan, this problem would need the use of a planner software in order to perform an optimal solution.

...the methods hierarchy 
0 solve_logistic_problem -> M0-Achieve-At-0 1
1 Achieve-At -> M5-DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE 2 3
...there are 28 methods decompositions and they follow the same pattern. Some of them could be seen next:
2 Achieve-At0 -> M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 3 4
3 Achieve-At-TRK -> m1_ordering_1 5 6 7
4 Achieve-At1 -> M6-DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK 8 9

15 Deliver_person -> m3_ordering 19 20 
16 Deliver_package -> m3_ordering 21 22 
17 Move -> i-move 23 24 
18 debark -> i-debark 25 26 
... Due to the complexity of this problem I was forced to take action on my explanations.

28 Achieve_at OBJ53 POS11
