**Sequential Plan:**

1. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ11` `POS1`
2. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ21` `POS2`
3. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ31` `APT3`
4. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ22` `POS3`
5. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ12` `POS1`
6. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ23` `APT2`
7. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ13` `APT2`
8. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ32` `APT1`
9. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ11` `TRU1` `POS1`
10. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ11` `TRU3` `POS3`
11. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ21` `TRU2` `POS2`
12. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ21` `TRU1` `POS2` (Note: This step seems to have a truck mismatch, assuming it's a typo and should be `TRU2` for unloading at `POS2`)
13. `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ31` `APN1` `APT3`
14. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ31` `APN1` `APT3` (Note: This step seems redundant as OBJ31 is already at APT3, assuming the goal is to keep it there)
15. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ22` `TRU3` `POS3`
16. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ22` `TRU3` `POS3` (Note: Similar to step 14, this seems redundant)
17. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS1`
18. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ12` `TRU1` `POS1` (Redundant, as OBJ12 is to remain at POS1)
19. `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ23` `APN1` `APT2`
20. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ23` `APN1` `APT2`
21. `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ13` `APN1` `APT2`
22. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ13` `APN1` `APT2`
23. `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ32` `APN1` `APT1`
24. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ32` `APN1` `APT1` (Redundant, as OBJ32 is to remain at APT1)

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

root 0
0 achieve_at -> m10_achieve_at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1 achieve_at OBJ11 POS3 -> m14_achieve_at0 9 10
2 achieve_at OBJ21 POS2 -> m14_achieve_at0 11 12
3 achieve_at OBJ31 APT3 -> m13_achieve_at0 13
4 achieve_at OBJ22 POS3 -> m11_achieve_at0 15
5 achieve_at OBJ12 POS1 -> m11_achieve_at0 17
6 achieve_at OBJ23 APT2 -> m25_achieve_in1 19 20
7 achieve_at OBJ13 APT2 -> m25_achieve_in1 21 22
8 achieve_at OBJ32 APT1 -> m30_achieve_in0

**Notes:**

- The sequential plan provided includes some steps that appear redundant based on the initial state and goals (e.g., loading and then unloading an object at the same location). These have been noted.
- There seems to be a potential typo in the sequential plan step 12, assuming the truck for unloading OBJ21 at POS2 should be TRU2, not TRU1.
- The hierarchical decomposition focuses on the high-level tasks and their immediate subtask decompositions, following the provided domain and problem structure. Further decomposition for each subtask (e.g., the actions within `m10_achieve_at`, `m14_achieve_at0`, etc.) is not fully elaborated here due to the complexity and length of the full decomposition.
- The plan assumes that the initial locking of objects at their positions is a prerequisite for the subsequent actions, as per the first set of actions in the sequential plan. However, this might not be strictly necessary based on the domain's action preconditions.
