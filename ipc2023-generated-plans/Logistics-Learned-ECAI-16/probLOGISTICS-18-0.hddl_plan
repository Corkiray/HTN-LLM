Unfortunately, generating an actual plan from an HTN domain and problem requires running a planner. However, we can still break down the tasks and methods involved in the problem.

The problem involves delivering packages to specific locations using trucks and airplanes. We can start by breaking down the tasks into their respective categories:

- Deliver packages to airports (e.g., OBJ13 to APT6, OBJ32 to APT5)
- Deliver packages to locations (e.g., OBJ43 to POS2, OBJ22 to POS6)

Now, let's go through a possible sequential plan:

1. Move APN1 from APT2 to APT1 (to allow for more deliveries)
2. Move TRU1 from POS1 to APT1 (to deliver packages)
3. Deliver OBJ61 to APT1 using TRU1
4. Deliver OBJ62 to APT1 using TRU1
5. Deliver OBJ63 to APT3 using APN1
6. Move TRU2 from POS2 to APT2 (to deliver packages)
7. Deliver OBJ21 to POS2 using TRU2
8. Deliver OBJ22 to POS6 using TRU6
9. Deliver OBJ23 to POS5 using TRU5
10. Move TRU3 from POS3 to APT3 (to deliver packages)
11. Deliver OBJ31 to POS4 using TRU4
12. Deliver OBJ32 to APT5 using APN2
13. Deliver OBJ33 to POS6 using TRU6
14. Move TRU4 from POS4 to APT4 (to deliver packages)
15. Deliver OBJ41 to POS1 using TRU1
16. Deliver OBJ42 to POS2 using TRU2
17. Deliver OBJ43 to POS2 using TRU2
18. Move TRU5 from POS5 to APT5 (to deliver packages)
19. Deliver OBJ51 to POS4 using TRU4
20. Deliver OBJ52 to POS2 using TRU2
21. Deliver OBJ53 to POS2 using TRU2
22. Deliver OBJ11 to POS2 using TRU2
23. Deliver OBJ12 to POS2 using TRU2
24. Deliver OBJ13 to APT6 using APN2

This is just one possible plan; the actual plan might involve different sequences of actions depending on the HTN planner used.

Here is a possible hierarchical plan:

==>
1 move APN1 APT2 APT1
2 move TRU1 POS1 APT1
3 DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ61 TRU1 APT1
4 deliver OBJ61 POS6 APT1
5 move APN1 APT1 POS3
6 move TRU3 POS3 APT3
7 DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ63 TRU3 APT3
8 move TRU2 POS2 APT2
9 DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ22 TRU2 APT2
10 deliver OBJ22 POS6 APT2
11 move TRU3 APT3 POS4
12 DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ31 TRU4 POS4
13 move APN2 APT6 APT5
14 move TRU5 POS5 APT5
15 DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ32 TRU5 APT5
16 deliver OBJ32 POS2 APT5
17 move TRU6 POS6 APT6
root 0
0 Achieve-at OBJ13 APT6 -> M4-DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 12 13 14 15 16
18 Achieve-at OBJ53 POS2 -> m1_ordering_0 19 20 21

20 Achieve-at OBJ41 POS4 -> m3_ordering_0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
21 Achieve-at OBJ33 POS6 -> m1_ordering_0 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
22 Achieve-at OBJ32 APT5 -> M5-DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
<==

This plan is not complete and doesn't show all the deliveries. It illustrates a hierarchical structure where methods like M4-DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 and M5-DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 are applied to achieve tasks like Achieve-at OBJ13 APT6 and Achieve-at OBJ32 APT5.

Please note that running an HTN planner like SHOP2 or HTN-Plan would provide a complete and correct plan for this problem.
