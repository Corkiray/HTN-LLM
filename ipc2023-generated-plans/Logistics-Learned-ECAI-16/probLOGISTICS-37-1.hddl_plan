Since the problem statement does not specify a goal, let's consider a goal to transport packages to different locations.

Assuming we want to move `OBJ11` to `POS4` and `OBJ21` to `APT13`, the plan could be:

1 move TRU1 POS1 POS4
2 board OBJ11 TRU1 POS4
3 move TRU2 POS2 APT13
4 board OBJ21 TRU2 APT13
5 deliver OBJ11 POS4
6 deliver OBJ21 APT13

0 solve_elevator -> m1_go_ordering_0 1 2
5 deliver_person p0 f1 f0 -> m2_ordering_0 3 4 5 6
6 solve_elevator -> m1_abort_ordering_0

However, this plan seems to be tailored for elevators. For logistics problem:

root 0
0 transport_package -> m_transportation_0 1 2
1 load_package -> m_load_truck_0 3 4
2 transport_package -> m_transportation_1 5 6
3 deliver_package -> m_deliver_package_0 7 8
