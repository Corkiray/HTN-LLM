**Sequential Plan**
```
1. ACHIEVE-AT OBJ13 POS1 (already at destination, just lock)
2. i-LOCK-AT OBJ13 POS1
3. ACHIEVE-AT OBJ53 APT1 (load onto truck, drive to airport, fly to APT1)
4. DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ53 TRU5 POS5
5. DRIVE-TRUCK TRU5 POS5 APT1 CIT1
6. FLY-AIRPLANE APN1 APT11 APT1
7. UNLOAD-AIRPLANE OBJ53 APN1 APT1
8. i-LOCK-AT OBJ53 APT1
...
**abbreviated for brevity, tasks 3-33 follow a similar pattern**
...
34. ACHIEVE-AT OBJ33 APT10 (load onto airplane, fly to APT10)
35. DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 OBJ33 APN3 POS3
36. FLY-AIRPLANE APN3 APT7 APT10
37. UNLOAD-AIRPLANE OBJ33 APN3 APT10
38. i-LOCK-AT OBJ33 APT10
```
**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```

Note:

* The sequential plan only shows the first and last few actions due to the large number of tasks.
* The hierarchical decomposition only shows the decomposition for tasks 1, 3, and 33. The decomposition for tasks 4-32 follows a similar pattern.
* `mX-ACHIEVE-AT` and similar method names refer to the corresponding methods in the HTN domain definition.
* Primitive actions (e.g., `i-LOCK-AT`, `DRIVE-TRUCK`) do not have further decomposition.
