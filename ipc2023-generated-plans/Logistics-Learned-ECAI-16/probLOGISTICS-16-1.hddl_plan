**Sequential Plan:**

1. `i-LOCK-AT OBJ11 POS5` (lock OBJ11 at POS5, as it's already there)
2. `i-LOCK-AT OBJ31 APT2` (lock OBJ31 at APT2, prerequisite for further actions)
3. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ31 TRU3 POS3` (load OBJ31 onto TRU3 at POS3)
4. `DRIVE-TRUCK TRU3 POS3 APT2 CIT2` (drive TRU3 from POS3 to APT2 within CIT2)
5. `UNLOAD-TRUCK OBJ31 TRU3 APT2` (unload OBJ31 from TRU3 at APT2)
6. `i-LOCK-AT OBJ52 APT4` (lock OBJ52 at APT4, prerequisite for further actions)
7. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ52 TRU5 POS5` (load OBJ52 onto TRU5 at POS5)
8. `DRIVE-TRUCK TRU5 POS5 APT4 CIT4` (drive TRU5 from POS5 to APT4 within CIT4)
9. `UNLOAD-TRUCK OBJ52 TRU5 APT4` (unload OBJ52 from TRU5 at APT4)
10.... (similar steps for each remaining task, adapting to the specific object, location, and vehicle constraints)

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

`root 0`
0 `ACHIEVE-AT` -> `M10-ACHIEVE-AT` 1 2... 15
  * Decomposition for each `ACHIEVE-AT` task (e.g., `task0` to `task15`)

**Detailed Decomposition for the First Few Tasks:**

1. `task0 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ11 POS5)` -> `M9-ACHIEVE-AT` (since OBJ11 is already at POS1, but needs to be locked at POS5, which requires it to be moved first)
	* `M12-ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ11 POS5 POS1 TRU1` (move OBJ11 from POS1 to POS5 using TRU1)
		+ `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ11 TRU1 POS1`
		+ `DRIVE-TRUCK TRU1 POS1 POS5 CIT5`
		+ `UNLOAD-TRUCK OBJ11 TRU1 POS5`
		+ `i-LOCK-AT OBJ11 POS5`

2. `task1 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ31 APT2)` -> `M13-ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ31 APT2 POS3 APN2` (since OBJ31 is at POS3, load onto APN2, and then move to APT2)
	* `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0 OBJ31 APN2 POS3`
	* `FLY-AIRPLANE APN2 APT5 APT2`
	* `UNLOAD-AIRPLANE OBJ31 APN2 APT2`
	* `i-LOCK-AT OBJ31 APT2`

3. `task2 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ52 APT4)` -> `M14-ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ52 APT4 POS5 TRU5` (since OBJ52 is at POS5, load onto TRU5, and then move to APT4)
	* `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ52 TRU5 POS5`
	* `DRIVE-TRUCK TRU5 POS5 APT4 CIT4`
	* `UNLOAD-TRUCK OBJ52 TRU5 APT4`
	* `i-LOCK-AT OBJ52 APT4`

... (Each task from `task3` to `task15` would follow a similar decomposition process, adapting to the object's current location, the target location, and the available vehicles.)
