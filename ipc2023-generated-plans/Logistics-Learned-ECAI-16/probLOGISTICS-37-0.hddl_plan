The plan to solve this problem consists of a sequence of tasks that need to be executed to achieve the goal of delivering the packages to their destination.

Here is an example of the plan that can be generated by the planner:

==>
1 move APN1 APT12 -> APT13
2 board TRU1 APN1
3 move TRU1 POS1 -> POS13
4 move OBJ11 POS1 -> POS13
5 move OBJ12 POS1 -> POS13
6 move OBJ13 POS1 -> POS13
7... (similar steps for other trucks and objects)
... 
=> 38 tasks

root 0
0 achieve-at OBJ13 POS13 -> m4-do-at-load-truck0 3 4 5 6
0 achieve-at OBJ12 POS12 -> m4-do-at-load-truck0 7 8 9 10
0 achieve-at OBJ11 POS11 -> m4-do-at-load-truck0 11 12 13 14
...
root 1
1 achieve-at TRU1 POS13 -> m6-do-in-unload-truck0 3 4 5 6
1 achieve-at TRU2 POS12 -> m6-do-in-unload-truck0 7 8 9 10
1 achieve-at TRU3 POS11 -> m6-do-in-unload-truck0 11 12 13 14
...
...

Note that the exact plan generated by the planner may vary depending on the specific planner used and the specific domain model.

This plan consists of a sequence of tasks that need to be executed to achieve the goal of delivering the packages to their destination. The tasks are divided into two main categories:

* `m4-do-at-load-truck0` tasks: these tasks involve loading the objects onto the trucks at their initial positions.
* `m6-do-in-unload-truck0` tasks: these tasks involve unloading the objects from the trucks at their destination positions.

The plan also involves moving the trucks and objects to their destination positions using the `move` task.

The `achieve-at` tasks are used to achieve the goal of delivering the packages to their destination. These tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks using the `m4-do-at-load-truck0` and `m6-do-in-unload-truck0` methods.

The `root` node represents the top-level task of delivering the packages to their destination. The `achieve-at` tasks are the sub-tasks of the `root` node.

The numbers in the plan represent the order in which the tasks need to be executed. The `=>` symbol represents the end of the plan.
