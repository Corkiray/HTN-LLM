**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 31 `i-LOCK-AT` actions to lock each object at its target location.
* The hierarchical decomposition is shown for the first task `ACHIEVE-AT OBJ12 POS6` and would be similarly applied to tasks 2-30.
* The decomposition uses methods from the logistics domain, such as `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`, `M14-ACHIEVE-AT0`, `M6-DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0`, etc.
* Each method invocation is followed by its corresponding task decomposition, showing the ordered subtasks.
* Actions like `i-LOCK-AT`, `i-UNLOCK-AT`, `UNLOAD-TRUCK`, `DRIVE-TRUCK`, etc. are part of the domain's action set.
