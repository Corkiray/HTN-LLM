Please note the plan is not correct and is not complete, the reason is there are some methods that are called but not defined, for example i-UNLOCK-AT is called in method IFUNLOCK1-AT but it does not exist, also methods for unlocking inside the truck or the airplane and unloading packages are missing.

This plan is just an approximation based on the data given, some methods need to be called but they don't exist, therefore they are called as examples and they would need to be implemented.

Also the ACHIEVE_AT methods for the airplanes are missing in the plan and should be similar to the ACHIEVE_AT-TRK.

Please also note that there are incomplete tasks in this HTN domain, and also missing methods, as mentioned earlier.
