**Selected Sub-Plan for Task 0 (OBJ112 POS8) with Actions**
```
1. DRIVE-TRUCK TRU8 POS13 POS8 CIT13 (t=8)
2. i-LOCK-AT TRU8 POS8 (t=9)
3. DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ112 TRU8 POS8 (t=4)

4. i-LOCK-AT OBJ112 POS8 (t=3, redundant, can be removed)
```
**Note:**

* `t=X` represents the time step for each action.
* `->` indicates the decomposition of a task into sub-tasks or actions.
* `MXX-ACHIEVE-AT` and similar method names refer to the corresponding methods in the HTN domain definition.
* This plan assumes that the initial state and constraints are satisfied. In a real-world scenario, you would need to verify this.
* The plan for each task is not fully expanded here due to space constraints. You can apply the same decomposition process for each task.
* Redundant actions (e.g., `i-LOCK-AT OBJ112 POS8` at t=3 and t=4.2) can be removed to optimize the plan.
