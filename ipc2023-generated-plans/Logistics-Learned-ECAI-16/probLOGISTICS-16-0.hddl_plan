**Sequential Plan:**

1. `i-UNLOCK-AT` `OBJ53` `POS5` (precondition for `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`)
2. `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ53` `APT5` (using `M13-ACHIEVE-AT0` with `APN2` and `POS5`)
	* `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ53` `APN2` `POS5`
		+ `ACHIEVE-AT-AIR` `APN2` `POS5` (using `M38-ACHIEVE-AT`)
			- `i-LOCK-AT` `APN2` `POS5`
		+ `LOAD-AIRPLANE` `OBJ53` `APN2` `POS5`
	* `FLY-AIRPLANE` `APN2` `APT2` `APT5`
	* `ACHIEVE-AT2` `APN2` `APT5` (using `M40-ACHIEVE-AT2`)
3. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ53` `APT5` (final lock)

4. `i-UNLOCK-AT` `OBJ12` `POS1` (precondition for `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`)
5. `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ12` `APT5` (using `M13-ACHIEVE-AT0` with `APN1` and `POS1`)
	* `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ12` `APN1` `POS1`
		+ `ACHIEVE-AT-AIR` `APN1` `POS1` (using `M38-ACHIEVE-AT`)
			- `i-LOCK-AT` `APN1` `POS1`
		+ `LOAD-AIRPLANE` `OBJ12` `APN1` `POS1`
	* `FLY-AIRPLANE` `APN1` `APT4` `APT5`
	* `ACHIEVE-AT2` `APN1` `APT5` (using `M40-ACHIEVE-AT2`)
6. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ12` `APT5` (final lock)

... (similar steps for each remaining task, adapting to their specific locations and vehicles)

**Last few tasks for brevity:**

50. `i-UNLOCK-AT` `OBJ21` `POS2` (precondition for `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`)
51. `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ21` `APT3` (using `M12-ACHIEVE-AT0` with `TRU2` and `POS2`)
	* `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ21` `TRU2` `POS2`
		+ `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK` `TRU2` `POS2` (using `M33-ACHIEVE-AT`)
			- `i-LOCK-AT` `TRU2` `POS2`
		+ `LOAD-TRUCK` `OBJ21` `TRU2` `POS2`
	* `DRIVE-TRUCK` `TRU2` `POS2` `APT3` `CIT3`
	* `ACHIEVE-AT1` `TRU2` `APT3` (using `M35-ACHIEVE-AT1`)
52. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ21` `APT3` (final lock)

53. `i-UNLOCK-AT` `OBJ42` `POS3` (precondition for `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`)
54. `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ42` `POS3` (already at destination, just lock)
55. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ42` `POS3` (final lock)

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

root 0
0 achieve_all -> m_all_0 1 2... 53 54
1 achieve_OBJ53_APT5 -> m10_achieve_at_0 1 2 3
	* 1 i_unlock_at_OBJ53_POS5
	* 2 achieve_at0_OBJ53_APT5 -> m13_achieve_at0_0 2.1 2.2 2.3
		+ 2.1 do_at_load_airplane0_OBJ53_APN2_POS5 -> m5_do_at_load_airplane0_0 2.1.1 2.1.2 2.1.3
		+ 2.2 fly_airplane_APN2_APT2_APT5
		+ 2.3 achieve_at2_APN2_APT5 -> m40_achieve_at2_0
	* 3 i_lock_at_OBJ53_APT5
... (similar decomposition for each task)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan is highly condensed for brevity, focusing on key actions and method invocations. Actual plans would include more detailed steps, especially for actions like `ACHIEVE-AT0` which involve multiple method calls.
* The hierarchical decomposition is also condensed, showing only the top-level task decomposition and a few examples of deeper decomposition for clarity.
* This plan assumes the planner successfully resolves all preconditions and constraints without additional actions beyond what's shown here.
* Task and method numbers (e.g., `task0`, `m10_achieve_at_0`) are arbitrary for demonstration purposes. Actual planners would generate these based on the problem and domain definitions.
