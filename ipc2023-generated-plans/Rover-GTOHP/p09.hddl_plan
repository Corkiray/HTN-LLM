Note that this plan assumes the following:

* The `do_calibrate` action is only performed once for each camera-objective pair, even if the same camera is used for multiple image tasks.
* The `navigate` actions are only performed when necessary, i.e., when the rover is not already at the desired waypoint.
* The `visit` and `unvisit` actions are only performed when necessary, i.e., when the waypoint has not been visited before.
* The `drop` action is only performed when the store is full.
* The `communicate_*_data` actions are only performed when the corresponding data is available.
