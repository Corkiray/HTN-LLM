Note:
- The plan is a sequence of actions (1-85) that achieve the goal.
- The hierarchical decomposition (root 0) shows the tasks and their corresponding methods, with the action indices in parentheses.
- The plan assumes that `rover0` is the only available rover, and it is equipped with the necessary instruments (e.g., `camera4` for imaging).
- The plan might not be optimal, as the HTN planner's output depends on the domain and problem definitions, as well as the planner's configuration.
- Some actions (e.g., `visit` and `unvisit`) are auxiliary and help with navigation and task management.

Task explanations:

* `m7_get_soil_data`: Get soil data from a specific waypoint.
	+ Subtasks:
		1. Navigate to the waypoint (e.g., `do_navigate2` or `do_navigate1`).
		2. Empty the store (if not already empty).
		3. Sample soil.
		4. Send soil data.
* `m13_get_image_data`: Get image data from a specific objective and mode.
	+ Subtasks:
		1. Navigate to a visible waypoint for the objective (e.g., `do_navigate2` or `do_navigate1`).
		2. Calibrate the camera (if not already calibrated).
		3. Take an image.
		4. Send image data.
