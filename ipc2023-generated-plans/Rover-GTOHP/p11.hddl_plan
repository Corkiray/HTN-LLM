Note: The plan provided is a sequential plan, and the hierarchical decomposition is shown below it. The numbers in the plan refer to the action instances, and the numbers in the decomposition refer to the task instances. 

**Assumptions and Simplifications:**

1. **Single Rover**: The plan is generated assuming only `rover0` is available, as the problem statement does not specify which rover to use for each task. In a real-world scenario, task allocation among multiple rovers would be necessary for efficiency.
2. **Direct Navigation**: The plan assumes direct navigation between waypoints is always possible when `can_traverse` is true, without considering potential obstacles not modeled in the provided domain.
3. **Camera Calibration**: For image tasks, the plan assumes the camera can be calibrated at the starting waypoint of each image task, which might not always be the case depending on the specific calibration requirements.
4. **Store Emptying**: The plan empties the store after each sampling to ensure it's ready for the next sample. In practice, this might not be necessary if the store can hold multiple samples.
5. **Communication**: The plan assumes communication with the lander is always successful when the preconditions are met, without accounting for potential communication failures.
