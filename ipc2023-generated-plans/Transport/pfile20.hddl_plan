Given the provided HTN Domain and Problem, we will generate a hierarchical plan to solve the delivery tasks. 

We will use the methods defined in the domain to decompose the tasks and then use the actions to achieve the goals.

Here is a possible plan:

==>
1 get_to truck_0 city_loc_11
2 load truck_0 city_loc_11 package_0
3 get_to truck_0 city_loc_2
4 unload truck_0 city_loc_2 package_0
5 get_to truck_0 city_loc_3
6 load truck_0 city_loc_3 package_1
7 get_to truck_0 city_loc_13
8 unload truck_0 city_loc_13 package_1
9 get_to truck_0 city_loc_3
10 load truck_0 city_loc_3 package_2
11 get_to truck_0 city_loc_2
12 unload truck_0 city_loc_2 package_2
13 get_to truck_0 city_loc_4
14 load truck_0 city_loc_4 package_3
15 get_to truck_0 city_loc_13
16 unload truck_0 city_loc_13 package_3
17 get_to truck_0 city_loc_8
18 load truck_0 city_loc_8 package_4
19 get_to truck_0 city_loc_1
20 unload truck_0 city_loc_1 package_4
21 get_to truck_0 city_loc_10
22 load truck_0 city_loc_10 package_5
23 get_to truck_0 city_loc_1
24 unload truck_0 city_loc_1 package_5
root 0
0 deliver package_0 city_loc_2 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 1 2 3 4
25 deliver package_1 city_loc_13 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 6 7 8 25 26
26 deliver package_2 city_loc_2 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 10 11 12 27 28
27 deliver package_3 city_loc_13 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 14 15 16 29 30
28 deliver package_4 city_loc_1 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 18 19 20 31 32
29 deliver package_5 city_loc_1 -> m_deliver_ordering_0 22 23 24 33 34
30 get_to truck_0 city_loc_4 -> m_i_am_there_ordering_0
31 get_to truck_1 city_loc_13 -> m_i_am_there_ordering_0
32 get_to truck_0 city_loc_13 -> m_drive_to_ordering_0
33 load truck_0 city_loc_4 package_3 -> m_load_ordering_0
34 unload truck_0 city_loc_13 package_1 -> m_unload_ordering_0
<==

This plan starts by delivering package_0 to city_loc_2 using truck_0. Then it proceeds to deliver the remaining packages in the order specified by the problem, using the defined methods and actions to achieve the goals. 

The plan is generated by recursively applying the methods to decompose the tasks until we reach the actions that can be executed directly. The actions are then ordered to satisfy the preconditions and achieve the desired effects. 

Note that this plan assumes that the capacity of the trucks is sufficient to hold all the packages, and that the roads between locations allow for the trucks to travel between them.
