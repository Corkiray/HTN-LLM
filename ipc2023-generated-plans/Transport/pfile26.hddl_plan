Note:

* The sequential plan only shows the first and last few actions due to the large number of tasks (20 deliver tasks).
* The hierarchical decomposition shows the task decomposition for the first, second, and last deliver tasks. The remaining tasks follow a similar decomposition pattern.
* The `m_i_am_there_ordering_0` method is used when the vehicle is already at the required location, resulting in a `noop` action.
* The `m_drive_to_ordering_0` and `m_drive_to_via_ordering_0` methods are used for navigating between locations.
* The `m_load_ordering_0` and `m_unload_ordering_0` methods handle package loading and unloading, respectively.
