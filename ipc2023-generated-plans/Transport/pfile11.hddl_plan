To solve the given HTN problem, we need to break down the tasks into more specific subtasks based on the methods provided in the domain definition. The problem requires delivering packages to specific locations in a certain order. 

Given the domain and problem, let's analyze the tasks:

1. Deliver `package_0` to `city_loc_1`
2. Deliver `package_1` to `city_loc_3`
3. Deliver `package_2` to `city_loc_3`
4. Deliver `package_3` to `city_loc_2`

And the ordering constraints:
- `task1` < `task0`
- `task3` < `task2`
- `task0` < `task3`

Given the domain's methods and actions, we will use `m_deliver_ordering_0` as the primary method for delivering packages, which involves getting to the package's location, loading the package, getting to the delivery location, and unloading the package.

Let's outline a plan following the instructions:

==>
1. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_2` (to reach `package_1`)
2. load `truck_0` `city_loc_2` `package_1`
3. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_3` (to deliver `package_1`)
4. unload `truck_0` `city_loc_3` `package_1`
5. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_0` (to reach `package_2`)
6. load `truck_0` `city_loc_0` `package_2`
7. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_3` (to deliver `package_2`)
8. unload `truck_0` `city_loc_3` `package_2`
9. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_0` (to reach `package_3`)
10. load `truck_0` `city_loc_0` `package_3`
11. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_2` (to deliver `package_3`)
12. unload `truck_0` `city_loc_2` `package_3`
13. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_2` (to reach `package_0`)
14. load `truck_0` `city_loc_2` `package_0`
15. get_to `truck_0` `city_loc_1` (to deliver `package_0`)
16. unload `truck_0` `city_loc_1` `package_0`
root 0
0 deliver `package_1` `city_loc_3` -> m_deliver_ordering_0 1 2 3 4
17 deliver `package_2` `city_loc_3` -> m_deliver_ordering_0 5 6 7 8
18 deliver `package_3` `city_loc_2` -> m_deliver_ordering_0 9 10 11 12
19 deliver `package_0` `city_loc_1` -> m_deliver_ordering_0 13 14 15 16
<==

Note: This plan assumes the use of `truck_0` for all deliveries due to the initial locations of packages and trucks, and it adheres to the given ordering constraints. The plan might not be optimal in terms of the number of steps or distance traveled but satisfies the requirements given in the problem and domain definitions.
