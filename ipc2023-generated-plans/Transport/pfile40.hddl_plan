Note: This plan is not the only possible solution and might not be the most efficient one. The plan is generated based on the given HTN domain and problem, but the HTN planner might explore different branches and find alternative solutions.

Also, please note that this is a simplified representation of the plan, and in a real-world scenario, you might want to include more details such as the specific packages being transported, the capacity of the trucks, and the road network.

The plan can be broken down into several tasks:
- Deliver package-12 from city-loc-42 to city-loc-60
- Deliver package-13 from city-loc-36 to city-loc-17
- Deliver package-16 from city-loc-5 to city-loc-50
- Deliver package-18 from city-loc-44 to city-loc-13
- Deliver package-20 from city-loc-63 to city-loc-57

Each task is decomposed into several actions:
- Drive to the pick-up location
- Pick up the package
- Drive to the drop-off location
- Drop off the package

The plan is generated by applying the methods in the HTN domain, starting from the root task "deliver" and recursively decomposing it into smaller tasks until the primitive actions are reached.
