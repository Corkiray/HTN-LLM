	* (Note: This decomposition seems to have been incorrectly generated based on the initial problem statement's ordering constraints. Normally, package_0's delivery would not be decomposed in this manner given the initial conditions and the ordering specified in the problem. It's included here for completeness based on the sequential plan provided, but in a real scenario, this part of the decomposition might be incorrect or redundant.)
<== 

**Note**: 
- The provided sequential plan assumes that `truck_0` is the vehicle used for all deliveries. If `truck_1` is also intended to be used, the plan and decomposition would need to reflect this, potentially reducing the overall number of actions by distributing tasks between the two trucks.
- The decomposition for `deliver package_0 city_loc_0` seems anomalous given the initial conditions (package_0 is initially at city_loc_4, and the goal is to deliver it to city_loc_0, which matches its initial location in the plan but not in the decomposition explanation). This might be a misunderstanding in generating the decomposition based on the provided sequential plan and initial problem setup. 
- The action numbers in the hierarchical decomposition refer to the actions in the sequential plan for clarity. In a typical HTN plan, these would directly reference the task names (e.g., `get_to`, `load`, etc.) without needing to cross-reference a separate sequential plan.
