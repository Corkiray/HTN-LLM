This plan delivers package-81 from city-loc-15 to city-loc-49 using truck-0 and package-82 from city-loc-12 to city-loc-26 using truck-1. 

Here's a breakdown of the plan:

1. **Get to the package location**: Truck-0 goes to city-loc-15 (step 1) to pick up package-81, and truck-1 goes to city-loc-12 (step 5) to pick up package-82.
2. **Load the package**: Truck-0 loads package-81 at city-loc-15 (step 2), and truck-1 loads package-82 at city-loc-12 (step 6).
3. **Get to the delivery location**: Truck-0 goes to city-loc-49 (step 3) to deliver package-81, and truck-1 goes to city-loc-26 (step 7) to deliver package-82.
4. **Unload the package**: Truck-0 unloads package-81 at city-loc-49 (step 4), and truck-1 unloads package-82 at city-loc-26 (step 8).

This plan uses the `m_deliver_ordering_0` method to deliver each package, which involves the `get_to`, `load`, `get_to`, and `unload` tasks in sequence.
