**Note:**
- The sequential plan provided is a solution to the problem, but it might not be the only one or the most optimal.
- The hierarchical decomposition is based on the provided HTN domain and problem. It shows how the top-level tasks are decomposed into smaller subtasks using the methods defined in the domain.
- **Reordering**: To match the sequential plan, some tasks in the decomposition (e.g., `deliver package_0 city_loc_0`) were conceptually reordered. Normally, the HTN planner would select and order these based on the domain's constraints and the problem's initial state.
- **Truck Reuse**: For simplicity and to adhere to the provided sequential plan, the solution reuses `truck_0` for all deliveries. In a more complex scenario, `truck_1` could also be utilized to parallelize tasks, reducing overall time, but this would require additional planning and synchronization steps not reflected in the provided sequential plan.
