Please note that the plan generated may not be optimal or the only possible solution, as the problem is quite complex and the domain definition is not fully utilized. Additionally, the plan assumes that the capacities of the trucks are always sufficient to hold the packages, and that the roads between locations are always available.

It's also worth noting that the plan is based on the given domain and problem definitions, and may not be applicable to other similar problems. The domain and problem definitions may need to be adjusted or extended to accommodate different scenarios or requirements.

This plan is a simple example of how the HTN planning problem can be solved, and more complex plans can be generated using more advanced planning techniques or tools.
