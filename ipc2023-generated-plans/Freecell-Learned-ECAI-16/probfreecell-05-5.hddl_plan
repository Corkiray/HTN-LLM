Based on the given HTN Domain and Problem, I've generated a hierarchical plan to solve it. Please note that due to the complexity of the domain and problem, the plan might not be optimal or exhaustive.

Here's the plan:

5 SOLVE-ON -> m2_col_1 5 6 7 8
SOLVE-ON -> m1_col_2 9 10 11 12
SOLVE-ON -> m3_col_3 13 14 15

Here's a brief explanation of the plan:

The plan consists of 15 actions, divided into four sub-plans (m1_col_0, m2_col_1, m1_col_2, and m3_col_3). Each sub-plan solves a specific part of the problem.

m1_col_0: Moves C5 from HA to S4, and then places C5 in the column.

m2_col_1: Moves S3 from C5 to C4, and then places C4 in the column.

m1_col_2: Moves H5 from SA to S3, and then places S3 in the column.

m3_col_3: Moves C5 to home, and then unflags the bottom columns.

Please note that this plan is not guaranteed to be optimal or exhaustive, and might require additional actions to solve the problem completely.
