This plan solves the problem by first processing each part to achieve the desired color and surface condition, and then loading and unloading the high-speed saw to cut the board into the required parts.

Here is a brief explanation of the plan:

1. Process p1 to achieve the color red and surface condition smooth.
2. Process p2 to achieve the color red and surface condition smooth.
3. Process p0 to achieve the color red and surface condition rough.
4. Load the high-speed saw with board b0.
5. Unload the high-speed saw from board b0.
6-8: Load the high-speed saw, cut board b0 to create part p1, and unload the high-speed saw.
9-11: Load the high-speed saw, cut board b0 to create part p2, and unload the high-speed saw.
12-14: Load the high-speed saw, cut board b0 to create part p0, and unload the high-speed saw.

Note that this plan assumes that the high-speed saw is initially empty and that the board b0 is available. Additionally, the plan does not account for any potential errors or exceptions that may occur during the execution of the tasks.
