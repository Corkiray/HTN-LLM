Please note that the plan provided may not be the only solution and may vary based on the specific implementation of the planning algorithm used. The plan provided is based on the given HTN domain and problem, and it satisfies the conditions and goals specified in the problem. 

Here's a brief explanation of the plan:

* The plan starts by loading the high-speed saw with board b0.
* Then, it performs the do_saw action on board b0 and part p1.
* After that, it unloads the high-speed saw.
* The plan then performs the do_colour action on part p1 to change its color to natural.
* The plan repeats the same process for part p2.
* Finally, the plan performs the do_colour action on part p0 to change its color to natural.

The hierarchical decomposition of the plan is as follows:

* task0_grindNplane is decomposed into three subtasks: grindNplane p0, grindNplane p1, and grindNplane p2.
* Each grindNplane task is further decomposed into two subtasks: do_saw and do_colour.
* The do_saw task is decomposed into two subtasks: load_highspeed_saw and unload_highspeed_saw.
* The do_colour task is decomposed into two subtasks: do_colour and do_colour.

Note that the plan and the hierarchical decomposition may vary based on the specific implementation of the planning algorithm used.
