Note: 
- The plan is a sequence of 52 actions (1-52) that achieve the goal.
- The hierarchical decomposition (root) shows how each process task (p0-p14) is broken down into smaller tasks using various methods (m0-m16).
- Each method invocation in the decomposition corresponds to a subset of actions in the sequential plan.
- The plan assumes that the initial state and goal conditions are as specified in the problem definition.
- The plan might not be optimal, and there could be other valid plans to achieve the goal.
