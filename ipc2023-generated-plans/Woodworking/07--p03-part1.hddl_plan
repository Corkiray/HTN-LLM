To provide a solution plan for the given HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning domain, let's break down the tasks and methods provided in the domain definition and analyze how they can be used to achieve the specified goals.

Given the complexity of the domain and the requirements, we'll outline a sequential plan that is followed by a hierarchical decomposition, adhering to the requested format.

### Step 1: Identify the Goals
The goal is to have each part (p0, p1, p2, p3, p4) in a specific state regarding its availability, color, wood type, surface condition, and treatment.

### Step 2: Sequential Plan Outline
1. **Process p0**: Ensure p0 is available, colored green, treated with varnish, and has the correct size and wood type if necessary.
2. **Process p1**: Ensure p1 is available, colored black, has a very smooth surface, and is treated with varnish.
3. **Process p2**: Ensure p2 is available, colored mauve, made of teak, and has the correct size.
4. **Process p3**: Ensure p3 is available, has a very smooth surface, and is glazed.
5. **Process p4**: Ensure p4 is available, made of mahogany, and treated with varnish.

### Step 3: Hierarchical Decomposition
Given the tasks and the requirements, the hierarchical decomposition would involve breaking down these processes into more manageable tasks using the methods provided.

- **root 0**
  - **process_p0**: Involve tasks to color p0 green, apply varnish, ensure it's available.
    - **method0**: Use `do_colour` with immersion_varnisher or spray_varnisher for green color.
    - **apply_varnish**: Follow method0 for varnishing after color treatment.
  - **process_p1**: Involve tasks to color p1 black, ensure very smooth surface, apply varnish.
    - **method1**: Use `do_colour` with spray_varnisher for black color.
    - **surface_smoothing**: Use grinder and planer machines to achieve a very smooth surface.
    - **apply_varnish_p1**: Follow method1 for varnishing.
  - **process_p2**: Ensure p2 is correctly colored (mauve), made of teak, and sized appropriately.
    - **color_p2**: Use `do_colour` method for mauve color.
  - **process_p3**: Ensure p3 has a very smooth surface and is glazed.
    - **glaze_p3**: Use glazer machine for glazing.
    - **surface_smoothing_p3**: Achieve very smooth surface.
  - **process_p4**: Ensure p4 is made of mahogany and treated with varnish.
    - **varnish_p4**: Apply varnish using appropriate method.

## Final Plan

1 process p0
2 color p0 green

5 color p1 black
6 surface_smoothing p1
7 apply_varnish p1

9 color p2 mauve
10 process p3
11 surface_smoothing p3
12 glaze p3
13 process p4
14 varnish p4
root 0
0 process -> m0_process 1 2 3
1 color -> m1_color 2 5 9
2 surface_smoothing -> m2_surface_smoothing 6 11
3 apply_varnish -> m3_apply_varnish 3 7 14
4 glaze -> m4_glaze 12

```

This plan outlines the major steps and tasks necessary to achieve the goals stated in the problem, following the hierarchical decomposition approach. However, note that the exact implementation details, such as the specific methods (m0_process, m1_color, etc.), would need to adhere to the preconditions and postconditions outlined in the domain definition, which might require additional tasks or adjustments based on the initial state and the resources available.
