Note: The plan provided is a possible solution to the given problem. However, due to the complexity of the domain and the goal, the plan may not be optimal or unique. 

Also, note that the provided plan does not include the specific machine instances for some tasks (e.g., `do_colour`), as the problem statement does not provide enough information to determine which machine instance to use. You may need to modify the plan to include the specific machine instances based on your specific requirements. 

Additionally, some tasks in the plan may have preconditions that are not explicitly stated in the problem statement. You may need to add additional tasks or modify the existing tasks to ensure that all preconditions are met. 

It's also worth noting that the plan is based on the provided domain and goal, and it may not be applicable to other domains or goals. You may need to modify the plan or create a new plan based on the specific requirements of your problem.
