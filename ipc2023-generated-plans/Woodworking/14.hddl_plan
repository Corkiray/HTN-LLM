Note: The plan is not necessarily optimal, and there may be other possible plans that can solve the problem. The plan is based on the given domain and goal, and it may require some adjustments to work in a real-world scenario. 

The plan involves the following steps:

1. Process each part to achieve the desired surface condition and treatment.
2. Apply color to each part using the immersion varnisher or spray varnisher.
3. Cut and saw the boards to obtain the desired parts.
4. Use the high-speed saw to cut the boards.

The plan uses the following methods:

* m_grindNplane: Grind and plane the part to achieve the desired surface condition.
* m_do_colour: Apply color to the part using the immersion varnisher or spray varnisher.
* m_do_saw: Cut and saw the board to obtain the desired part.
* m_cut_and_saw: Cut and saw the board to obtain the desired part.
* m_cut_board: Cut the board using the high-speed saw.
