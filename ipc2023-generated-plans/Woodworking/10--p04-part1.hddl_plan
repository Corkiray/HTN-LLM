To solve the given HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning problem, we'll break down the goal into smaller tasks, applying methods defined in the domain to reach the goal state from the initial state.

Given the complexity of the domain and the goal, let's start by identifying key objectives for each part (p0, p1, p2, p3, p4) mentioned in the goal:

1. **p0**: colour = red, wood = beech, surface = verysmooth, treatment = glazed
2. **p1**: wood = pine, surface = verysmooth
3. **p2**: surface = verysmooth, treatment = glazed
4. **p3**: colour = red, wood = beech, surface = verysmooth, treatment = varnished
5. **p4**: No specific goals mentioned for p4 in the provided goal.

The plan involves several steps, including processing each part to achieve the desired properties (colour, wood type, surface smoothness, and treatment status). 

### Sequential Plan

1. **Process p3**: Given p3 needs to be red, made of beech, verysmooth, and varnished.
   - Since p3 needs to be varnished and the only methods provided for colouring/treating parts involve varnishing, we'll apply a method similar to `method0` or `method1` for varnishing after ensuring it's the right wood and smooth enough.
   
2. **Process p0**: Needs to be red, beech, verysmooth, and glazed.
   - Unlike varnishing, glazing isn't directly supported by the provided methods, so we'll have to improvise with the given domain, possibly using the glazer for colouring.

3. **Process p1**: Needs to be pine and verysmooth.
   - Assuming a piece of pine wood is available or can be cut from a larger piece (b3 is pine), we focus on achieving verysmooth surface condition.

4. **Process p2**: Needs to be verysmooth and glazed.
   - Similar to p0, achieving a glazed status might require creative use of the domain's machines and treatments.

5. **Process p4**: Since no specific goals are mentioned for p4 in the question, we'll focus on the other parts.

### Hierarchical Decomposition

Given the lack of detailed steps for each machine interaction and considering the provided methods, let's focus on the hierarchical aspect:

```
==>
1 process p3
2 process p0
3 process p1
4 process p2
root 0
0 process_all_parts -> process_p3 1
                  -> process_p0 2
                  -> process_p1 3
                  -> process_p2 4
<==
```

However, the actual steps to achieve each part's desired state (e.g., using the highspeed_saw to cut wood, the grinder or planer to smooth surfaces, and the varnishers for colouring) depend heavily on the specific domain actions and preconditions not fully detailed here. Therefore, the plan outlined above focuses on the high-level structure rather than low-level machine interactions.

For a more detailed plan, we'd need to:
- Apply `method0` or `method1` for varnishing parts like p3.
- Utilize the glazer for colouring parts like p0 and p2, assuming a method for glazing can be derived from the domain.
- Ensure each part is made of the correct wood type, possibly involving cutting boards (b0, b1, b2, b3) into parts.
- Achieve the verysmooth surface condition using the grinder or planer.

The decomposition and sequence would depend on the specific capabilities and preconditions of each machine in the domain, as well as the availability of necessary resources like wood pieces of the correct type and size.
