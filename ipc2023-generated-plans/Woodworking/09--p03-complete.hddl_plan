This plan solves the given HTN domain. The plan consists of a sequence of tasks, followed by the hierarchical decomposition of each task.

Here's a brief explanation of each task:

- `process p0 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p0 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `process p1 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p1 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `process p2 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p2 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `do_colour p3 natural spray_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a colour to part p3 using spray_varnisher0.
- `process p3 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p3 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `process p4 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p4 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `do_colour p5 natural spray_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a colour to part p5 using spray_varnisher0.
- `process p5 natural rough verysmooth`: Process part p5 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `do_colour p0 green spray_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a green colour to part p0 using spray_varnisher0.
- `do_colour p1 black immersion_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a black colour to part p1 using immersion_varnisher0.
- `do_colour p2 mauve immersion_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a mauve colour to part p2 using immersion_varnisher0.
- `grindNplane p3 verysmooth natural untreated verysmooth natural untreated`: Grind and plane part p3 to achieve a surface condition of verysmooth.
- `do_colour p4 natural immersion_varnisher0 untreated`: Apply a natural colour to part p4 using immersion_varnisher0.

The hierarchical decomposition of each task is as follows:

- `solve_p0`: Decomposes into `m_process_0`, which consists of tasks 1, 2, and 9.
- `solve_p1`: Decomposes into `m_process_1`, which consists of tasks 3, 10, and 2.
- `solve_p2`: Decomposes into `m_process_2`, which consists of tasks 4 and 11.
- `solve_p3`: Decomposes into `m_process_3`, which consists of tasks 5 and 12.
- `solve_p4`: Decomposes into `m_process_4`, which consists of tasks 6 and 13.
- `solve_p5`: Decomposes into `m_process_5`, which consists of tasks 7 and 8.
