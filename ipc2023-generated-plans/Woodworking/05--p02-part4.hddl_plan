Note: This plan is not guaranteed to be optimal or correct, as the complexity of the HTN domain and problem requires a more sophisticated planning algorithm to solve. The provided plan is a possible solution based on the given HTN domain and problem, but it may not meet all the requirements or constraints specified in the problem. 

Also, note that some tasks and methods in the HTN domain are not used in the plan, this could be due to the fact that they are not necessary to solve the problem or that the planning algorithm was not able to find a solution that uses them. 

It's also worth mentioning that the plan is not a straightforward sequence of actions, but rather a hierarchical decomposition of tasks into subtasks, which is a characteristic of HTN planning. 

In order to get a correct and optimal plan, it's recommended to use a HTN planning algorithm, such as SHOP2 or Pyhop, which can handle the complexity of the HTN domain and problem.
