Note: This solution assumes that the tasks and methods are defined in the given HTN domain and that the planning problem is solvable. The plan may not be optimal or complete, but it should satisfy the given constraints and goals.

Also, note that the numbers in the plan (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) represent the task IDs, and the names (e.g., process, grindNplane, do_colour, etc.) represent the task names. The -> symbol indicates the decomposition of a task into subtasks. The numbers in parentheses (e.g., 1 2 3 4 5 6) represent the subtask IDs that are part of the decomposition. 

Here's a brief explanation of each step:

1. Process p23: This task involves processing part p23 to achieve the desired surface condition and treatment.
2. GrindNplane p23: This task involves grinding and planing part p23 to achieve the desired surface condition.
3. Do_colour p23: This task involves applying color to part p23 using an immersion varnisher.
4. Cut_board b1 p23: This task involves cutting board b1 into part p23 using a high-speed saw.
5. Do_saw b1 p23: This task involves sawing board b1 into part p23 using a saw.

The hierarchical decomposition of the tasks is as follows:

* Process -> m_process_0: This decomposition involves breaking down the process task into subtasks, including grindNplane, do_colour, cut_board, and do_saw.
* GrindNplane -> m_grindNplane_0: This decomposition involves breaking down the grindNplane task into subtasks.
* Do_colour -> m_do_colour_0: This decomposition involves breaking down the do_colour task into subtasks.
* Cut_board -> m_cut_board_0: This decomposition involves breaking down the cut_board task into subtasks.
* Do_saw -> m_do_saw_0: This decomposition involves breaking down the do_saw task into subtasks.
