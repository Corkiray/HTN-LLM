Note that the plan provided is a possible solution to the problem and may not be the only one. The plan is a sequence of tasks and actions that achieve the goals specified in the problem. 

In this plan, we first process part p0, which involves applying a colour (blue) and treatment (varnished) to it. We then load and unload board b0 from the high-speed saw, which is necessary for the next steps. After that, we apply a spray varnish to part p0, which changes its treatment status from untreated to varnished. 

Next, we process part p1. Since the problem does not specify any specific actions for part p1, we assume that it is already available and has the desired properties (wood type, surface condition, and treatment status). 

Finally, we apply a colour (blue) and treatment (varnished) to part p5 using the spray varnisher. This involves changing its treatment status from glazed to varnished. 

The hierarchical decomposition of the plan is as follows: 
- The task "process" is decomposed into the methods "method0" and "method1". 
- The task "do_colour" is decomposed into the method "method1". 

Note that this plan may not be optimal and may require further refinement or optimization to achieve the goals in the most efficient way possible.
