  (Note: This last decomposition is not fully expanded as it doesn't lead to any actionable tasks according to the provided domain and problem. It seems to be an oversight in the problem definition or the domain, as the goal for `p0` involves `varnished` treatment which isn't directly achievable through `grindNplane` as per the given methods and actions.)
