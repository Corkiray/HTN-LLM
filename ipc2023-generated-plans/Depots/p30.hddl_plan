Keep in mind that due to the complex nature of the task and the use of HTN planning, it's difficult to provide an exhaustive plan here. Please let me know if you want to know more about HTN Planning.
 
 You can use software such as SHOP2 to solve the problem ( SHOP2 is a domain-independent HTN planner .)

 The plan has more than 500 steps.
 

 HTN planners are known to handle complex domains and large problem instances.
