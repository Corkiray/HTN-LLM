Due to the complexity of the provided HTN domain and the fact that a hierarchical task network (HTN) planner is required to solve this problem, I will provide a step-by-step approach on how to solve it. However, I won't be able to provide a complete and accurate plan without running the HTN planner.


Step 1: Identify the tasks and methods
The HTN domain defines several tasks, including do_put_on, do_clear, do_get_truck, do_lift_crate, do_load_truck, and do_unload_truck. Each task has multiple methods that provide different ways to accomplish the task.

Step 2: Apply the methods to the tasks
To solve the problem, we need to apply the methods to the tasks in a way that satisfies the preconditions and achieves the goal.

Here is a possible plan:
==>

1. do_get_truck ?t0 ?p2
2. Drive ?t0 ?p2 ?p0
3. do_clear ?s73 ?p0

root 0
0 solve_depot -> m7_do_get_truck 1 2
4 do_put_on ?c95 ?s73 -> m2_do_put_on 3 5 6 7
5 do_load_truck ?c95 ?s81 ?p0 ?t0 ?h0

root 1
1 solve_depot -> m10_do_load_truck 4 8 9 10 11
12 do_unload_truck ?c97 ?s91 ?p2 ?t0 ?h0

root 2
2 solve_depot -> m11_do_unload_truck 12 13 14 15
16 do_put_on ?c72 ?s97 -> m0_do_put_on

(root 0, 1, and 2 represent the hierarchical decomposition of the plan)

Some notes on this plan:

- The plan starts by getting the truck ?t0 from its initial location ?p2 to ?p0.
- Then, it clears the surface ?s73 at ?p0.
- Next, it loads the crate ?c95 onto the truck ?t0 at ?p0.
- The plan then unloads the crate ?c97 from the truck ?t0 at ?p2.
- Finally, it puts the crate ?c72 onto the surface ?s97.

This is just one possible plan, and there may be other plans that achieve the goal.


Note that this plan is incomplete and might not satisfy all the preconditions and constraints of the problem. Running an HTN planner would provide the complete and accurate plan.
