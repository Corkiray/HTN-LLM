Unfortunately, solving this complex planning problem is beyond the capabilities of a simple AI response due to the large amount of data. However, I can provide you with information on how to approach this problem and possible steps to solve it.

First, we will break down the problem into three steps using a rough hierarchical task network (HTN) planning approach:

1.  **Break down achieve-goals task**

    The planner will try to achieve the goals by selecting the methods to apply based on their preconditions.

    ===>
    1 putdown b29
    2 release
    3 acquire b29
    ...
    <==

2.  **Further decomposition of the tasks**

    Based on the current state, the planner will select the methods to apply based on their preconditions, and the tasks will be decomposed into more primitive ones.

    root 0
    0 achieve-goals -> method_1 1 2 3
    1 putdown b29 -> newMethod10 4
    2 release -> release_table b29 5
    3 acquire b29 -> unstack_block b29 6 7 8
    ...
    <==

3.  **Primitive actions**

    Once the planner has decomposed the tasks into primitive actions, it will start applying these actions, updating the current state after each action.

    root 0
    0 achieve-goals -> method_1 1 2 3
    1 putdown b29 -> newMethod10 4
    2 release -> release_table b29 5
    3 acquire b29 -> unstack_block b29 6 7 8
    4 putdown b29
    5 putdown b29
    6 unstack b29 b78 9 10 11
    ...
    <==

Unfortunately, this problem has a complex HTN domain and a large input problem that makes the calculation of an actual plan impractical for a simple answer.

Note: If we have more simple HTN planning problems and less complex planning problems we could solve them manually or with tools such as SHOP2 or JSHOP2 planning systems.
