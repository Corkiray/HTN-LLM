The problem you've described is in the context of a classical planning problem, specifically a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning problem. 

However, without knowing what the specific goals and initial state are, we cannot provide a complete plan.

Assuming we have an initial state as described above and a goal state such as:

    (goal_on b672 b501)
    (goal_on b501 b672)
    (goal_on b674 b511)
    (goal_on b649 b568)
    (goal_on b568 b649)

And assuming the initial state is as described in the problem.

We can have a plan as follows:

==>
1 pickup b601
2 unstack b652 b601
3 stack b652 b511
4 pickup b511
5 unstack b574 b511
6 stack b574 b649
7 pickup b649
8 unstack b597 b649
9 stack b597 b568
10 pickup b568
11 unstack b524 b568
12 stack b524 b649 
13 release-stack b649 b568
14 release-stack b574 b649
15 release-stack b597 b568
16 release-stack b652 b511
17 pickup b672
18 putdown b672
19 pickup b501
20 stack b501 b672

This plan may or may not work depending on the specific problem instance. Also, this is just one possible plan among many valid plans. The HTN planning problem may have many different valid plans or even no valid plan at all.

This plan is also considering some extra preconditions in the newMethodX algorithms which were not available, we could use a pick up algorithm, that does the specific instructions needed for each different scenario to pick up the block in this domain in HTN.

This kind of problem may be solved using planners like SHOP2, or HDG, however the more easy one would be using an HTN planner which may be more suitable for Hierarchical Task Network problems.
