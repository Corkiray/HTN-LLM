Note: It's worth noting that there's a large number of blocks and relations in the given problem. However, the problem doesn't specify the goals we want to achieve. Therefore, I assumed the goal is to stack block b640 on top of block b499 as the goal.

Also, because the initial state is too large, I couldn't apply the HTN algorithm recursively, so I had to choose one possible goal and apply the methods to achieve that goal. The plan is quite simple and doesn't seem to fit the complexity of the initial state.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to provide the goals you want to achieve and run the HTN algorithm accordingly.
