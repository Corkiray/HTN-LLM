Due to the complexity of this problem, I can only give a partial solution. It's a very complex domain, and solving it completely would require a full-fledged planning system. Here's a possible plan for the first part of the goal:

==> 
1 mark_done b53
root 0
0 achieve-goals arm1 -> mark-done-table 1 2 
2 achieve-goals arm2 -> mark-done-on 3 4 5 
3 acquire_abstract b43 arm3 -> newMethod13 6 
4 stack_abstract b43 b30 -> newMethod15 7 8 9 
5 achieve-goals arm1 -> release-stack 10 11 12 13 
6 pickup b43 arm3 
7 pickup b30 arm2 
8 mark_done b53 
9 unstack b30 b22 arm1 
10 acquire_abstract b30 arm2 -> newMethod16 14 15 16 
11 stack_abstract b30 b22 -> newMethod15 17 18 19 
12 unstack b43 b30 arm3 
13 putdown_abstract b43 -> newMethod14 20 
14 unstack b30 b22 arm2 
15 unstack b22 b37 arm1 
16 unstack b37 b44 arm3 
17 unstack b43 b30 arm2 
18 unstack b30 b22 arm1 
19 unstack b22 b44 arm2 
20 putdown b43 arm2
