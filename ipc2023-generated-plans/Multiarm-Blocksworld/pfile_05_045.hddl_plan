Given the complexity of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan in the requested format is highly challenging without executing the HTN planning algorithm directly. However, I can guide you through a simplified, high-level outline of how the plan might be structured, focusing on key tasks and their decompositions. Please note, the actual plan execution would require running the HTN planner on the provided domain and problem, which cannot be directly performed in this response.

**Sequential Plan Outline (Simplified):**

This outline focuses on achieving the goals for a subset of blocks to illustrate the process. The full plan would be extensively longer and more complex, covering all blocks and their goal states.

1. **Achieve Goals for Arm1 (Partial Example)**
   - **Task**: `(achieve-goals arm1)`
   - **Subtasks** (selected examples, actual plan would include all necessary steps for all arms and blocks):
     1. **Stack b23 on b29**
        - **Task**: `(stack_abstract b23 b29)`
        - **Subtasks**:
          - `(acquire_abstract b23 arm1)` -> **Unstack/Pickup** `b23` if not clear, or directly pickup if clear and on-table.
          - **Stack** `b23` on `b29` if `b29` is clear.
     2. **Ensure b34 is on b8**
        - **Task**: `(stack_abstract b34 b8)`
        - **Subtasks**:
          - `(acquire_abstract b34 arm1)`
          - **Stack** `b34` on `b8` if `b8` is clear.
     3. **... (Similar steps for all other blocks and their goals)**

2. **Release and Achieve Goals for Other Arms (Similarly)**
   - Repeat the process for `arm2`, `arm3`, `arm4`, and `arm5`, ensuring each block's goal state is met.

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Partial, for illustration):**

```
==>
1 acquire_abstract b23 arm1
2 stack_abstract b23 b29
3 acquire_abstract b34 arm1
4 stack_abstract b34 b8
... (Extensive list of actions for all blocks and arms)
<==

root 0
0 achieve-goals arm1 -> m1_achieve_goals_arm1 1 2 3 4...
1 stack_abstract b23 b29 -> newMethod15 b23 b29 arm1
  - 1.1 acquire_abstract b23 arm1 -> newMethod16 b23?bottom arm1 (if b23 is on another block) or newMethod13 b23 arm1 (if b23 is clear and on-table)
  - 1.2 stack b23 b29 arm1
2 stack_abstract b34 b8 -> newMethod15 b34 b8 arm1
  - 2.1 acquire_abstract b34 arm1
  - 2.2 stack b34 b8 arm1
... (Decompositions for all tasks and subtasks, across all arms)
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Actual Plan Generation:** Requires executing an HTN planner with the provided domain and problem as inputs.
- **Simplification:** The above outline simplifies the problem by not fully elaborating on every step for each block and arm, focusing instead on illustrating the process.
- **Complexity:** The full plan would be significantly more complex, involving numerous conditional checks (e.g., `clear`, `on-table`, `holding`) and actions (e.g., `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`) to achieve all goal states for every block across all arms.
