Given the complexity of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan in the requested format is highly challenging without executing the HTN planning algorithm directly. However, I can guide you through a simplified, high-level outline of how one might approach solving this problem, focusing on the initial steps and the hierarchical decomposition. Please note, due to the problem's vast size (involving 100 blocks and 6 arms), a full, detailed plan cannot be reasonably provided in this format.

**Sequential Plan Initiation (Simplified Example):**

Given the vast number of goals, we'll focus on a simplified initiation of the plan, highlighting the first few steps for achieving a subset of the goals. This example will not cover all goals due to space and complexity constraints.

**Selected Goals for Demonstration:**

1. `(clear b73)`
2. `(on-table b97)`
3. `(on b73 b60)`
4. `(on b60 b97)`

**Initial Sequential Plan (Partial):**

```plaintext
==>
1. (unstack b73?bottom?arm) ; Assuming b73 is initially stacked,?bottom and?arm will be determined based on initial state analysis
2. (putdown b73?arm) ; Place b73 on the table to achieve (clear b73) and set up for (on b73 b60)
3. (pickup b60?arm) ; Prepare b60 to be placed on b97
4. (stack b60 b97?arm) ; Achieve (on b60 b97)
5. (pickup b73?arm) ; Prepare to place b73 on b60
6. (stack b73 b60?arm) ; Achieve (on b73 b60)
<==
```

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Partial, Focusing on Initial Steps):**

```plaintext
root 0
0 achieve-goals arm1 -> m1_init_achieve 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 unstack_abstract b73 -> newMethod16 b73?bottom arm1
2 putdown_abstract b73 -> newMethod14 b73 arm1
3 pickup_abstract b60 -> newMethod13 b60 arm1
4 stack_abstract b60 b97 -> newMethod15 b60 b97 arm1
5 pickup_abstract b73 -> newMethod13 b73 arm1
6 stack_abstract b73 b60 -> newMethod15 b73 b60 arm1
```

**Note:**

- `?arm` is a placeholder for any available arm (arm1 to arm6) that can perform the action, determined during planning.
- `?bottom` represents the block under b73, to be determined from the initial state.
- The plan and decomposition provided are highly simplified and focus on demonstrating the format and approach rather than solving the entire problem.
- A complete solution would require executing an HTN planner with the provided domain and problem, taking into account all goals, initial states, and available actions/methods.

To solve the entire problem, one would need to:
1. **Analyze the Initial State:** Understand the starting positions of all blocks and arms.
2. **Apply HTN Planning Algorithm:** Utilize a planner that can handle the complexity of the given domain and problem, applying methods and actions to achieve all specified goals.
3. **Generate a Complete Plan:** The planner would output a detailed, step-by-step plan in the form of actions (like `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`) and method invocations (like `achieve-goals`, `release`, `acquire_abstract`, etc.), tailored to achieve all goals.
