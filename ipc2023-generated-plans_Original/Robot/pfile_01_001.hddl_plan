Here is a hierarchical plan to solve the given HTN problem, following the specified output format:
```
==>
1 open c r1 d01
2 move c r1 d01
3 pickup o1 r1
4 putdown o1 r1
<==

root 0
0 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-open 1 2 3 4
  1 achieve-goals-open -> newMethod25 c r1 d01
    -> open c r1 d01 (1)
  2 achieve-goals-open -> newMethod24 c r1 d01
    -> move c r1 d01 (2)
  3 achieve-goals-pickup -> newMethod22 o1 r1
    -> pickup o1 r1 (3)
  4 release-putdown_abstract -> newMethod23 o1 r1
    -> putdown o1 r1 (4)
```
Here's a brief explanation of the plan:

1. **Open the door** (`open c r1 d01`): The robot is initially in room `c` with the door to room `r1` closed. Open the door to allow movement.
2. **Move to room r1** (`move c r1 d01`): With the door open, the robot can now move to room `r1` where the package `o1` is located.
3. **Pick up the package** (`pickup o1 r1`): In room `r1`, the robot picks up the package `o1`.
4. **Put down the package (in the same room)** (`putdown o1 r1`): Since the goal is to have the package `o1` in room `r1`, and it's already there, the robot simply puts down the package, fulfilling the goal.

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

* `achieve-goals` (root task) is decomposed into `achieve-goals-open` (method), which involves opening the door, moving, picking up the package, and putting it down.
* `achieve-goals-open` is further decomposed into:
	+ `newMethod25` (open door)
	+ `newMethod24` (move to room `r1`)
	+ `achieve-goals-pickup` (pick up package), which is decomposed into `newMethod22` (pickup action)
	+ `release-putdown_abstract` (put down package), which is decomposed into `newMethod23` (putdown action)
