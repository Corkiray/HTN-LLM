**Plan Explanation:**

1. **Initial Goal**: Achieve goals (i.e., `in o1 r3` and `in o2 r2`)
2. **First Decomposition (achieve-goals-pickup o1 r1)**:
	* Pick up `o1` in `r1` (1)
	* Open door `d13` to move from `r1` to `r3` (2)
	* Move from `r1` to `r3` through `d13` (3)
	* Put down `o1` in `r3` (4)
3. **Intermediate Movement (achieve-goals-move)**:
	* Open door `d13` to move back from `r3` to `r1` (5)
	* Move from `r3` to `r1` through `d13` (6)
4. **Second Decomposition (achieve-goals-pickup o2 r1)**:
	* Open door `d12` to move from `r1` to `r2` (7)
	* Move from `r1` to `r2` through `d12` (8)
	* Put down `o2` in `r2` (9)
5. **Final Achievement**:
	* Achieve goals (both packages are now in their target rooms) (10)

Note that some actions (e.g., `open` and `move`) are repeated with different parameters to facilitate the movement between rooms while achieving the goals. The plan assumes that the robot can perform these actions sequentially without any additional constraints.
