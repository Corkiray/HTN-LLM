Here is a hierarchical plan to solve the given HTN problem, following the specified output format:
```
==>
1 pickup o1 r3
2 move r3 r1 d13
3 pickup o2 r1
4 move r1 r2 d12
5 putdown o2 r2
6 move r2 r1 d12
7 move r1 r3 d13
8 pickup o3 r3
9 move r3 r1 d13
10 putdown o3 r1
11 move r1 r2 d12
12 pickup o1 r3 -> **NOT POSSIBLE** (o1 is not in r3 anymore, adjust plan)
**Adjusted Plan**
12' move r2 r3 d02
13' pickup o1 r3
14 putdown o1 r2

**Explanation of the Plan:**

1. **Initial Achieve-Goals**:
	* Pick up `o1` from `r3` (1) and move to `r1` (2).
	* Pick up `o2` from `r1` (3) and move to `r2` (4), then put down `o2` in `r2` (5).
2. **Intermediate Movement**:
	* Move from `r2` to `r1` (6) and then to `r3` (7) to set up for the next pickup.
3. **Second Achieve-Goals**:
	* Pick up `o3` from `r3` (8) and move to `r1` (9), then put down `o3` in `r1` (10).
4. **Final Adjusted Plan for o1**:
	* Move from `r1` to `r2` (11), then from `r2` to `r3` (12') to pick up `o1` (13'), and finally put down `o1` in `r2` (14).

**Note:** The original plan had an inconsistency (step 12), as `o1` was no longer in `r3` after the initial movements. The adjusted plan corrects this by moving to `r3` to pick up `o1` before placing it in `r2`.
