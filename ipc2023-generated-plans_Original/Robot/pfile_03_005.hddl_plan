    * **Added implicit move (not explicitly defined in the HTN methods but inferred for correctness)**
    * 10.5 move r2 r3 d13 (inferred for putdown o5 in r3)
    * **Updated 11**
    11 putdown o5 r3

**Implicit Moves and Adaptations:**

* To putdown o5 in r3, the robot needs to move from r2 to r3 (added step 10.5).
* The original problem's goal and init conditions imply that o3 should be moved to r3, but the provided HTN methods don't directly support this. The plan generated moves o3 to r3, assuming the goal is to satisfy the `in` conditions as closely as possible with the given methods.

**Note:** The provided HTN domain and problem description lead to some interpretations for generating a plan. Specifically, the handling of `o5` and `o3` involves assumptions based on the initial and goal states, as the direct methods for achieving the exact goal state are not fully specified in the given domain.
