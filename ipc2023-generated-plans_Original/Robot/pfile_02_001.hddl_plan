Here is a hierarchical plan to solve the given HTN problem, following the specified output format:
```
==>
1 pickup o1 r2
2 move r2 c d02
3 move c r1 d01
4 putdown o1 r1
<==

root 0
0 achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-pickup 1 2 3 4
  0.1 achieve-goals-pickup 
   ?loc - ROOM = r1
   ?obj - PACKAGE = o1
    -> newMethod22 1
    -> newMethod24 2 (with?loc1 = r2,?loc2 = c,?d = d02)
    -> newMethod24 3 (with?loc1 = c,?loc2 = r1,?d = d01)
    -> newMethod23 4
```
Here's a brief explanation of the plan:

1. **Sequential Plan** (===>... <==):
	* `1 pickup o1 r2`: Pick up package `o1` in room `r2`.
	* `2 move r2 c d02`: Move from `r2` to `c` through door `d02` (which needs to be opened first, but this is implicit in the `move` action's precondition).
	* `3 move c r1 d01`: Move from `c` to `r1` through door `d01`.
	* `4 putdown o1 r1`: Put down package `o1` in room `r1`, achieving the goal.
2. **Hierarchical Decomposition** (root...):
	* `0 achieve-goals`: The top-level task is to achieve the goals.
	* `achieve-goals -> achieve-goals-pickup 1 2 3 4`: Decompose `achieve-goals` into `achieve-goals-pickup`, which is applicable because `o1` is not in `r1` initially, but the goal is to have it there. This method requires picking up `o1` and then releasing it in `r1`.
	* `0.1 achieve-goals-pickup`: Bind variables for `achieve-goals-pickup`: `?loc = r1`, `?obj = o1`.
	* Sub-decompositions for each abstract task:
		+ `newMethod22 1`: Pickup `o1` in `r2`.
		+ `newMethod24 2` and `newMethod24 3`: Move through the doors (note: the `open` action is implicit for `d02`).
		+ `newMethod23 4`: Put down `o1` in `r1`.
