**Sequential Plan:**
(Note: The plan is quite long due to the complexity of the problem. I'll provide a condensed version, focusing on the key actions and their ordering. For brevity, some intermediate steps, especially those involving the recursive application of methods for each ring, are summarized.)

1. `selectDirection r20 t1 t2 t3` (Choose direction for the top ring r20)
2. `rotateTower t1 t3 t2` (Rotate towers to prepare for moving r20)
3. `move_abstract t1 t3` (Move t1 to t3 to free space for r20)
4. **Recursive Block for r19 to r1** (each step involves selecting direction, rotating towers, and moving the ring):
	* `selectDirection r[X] t1 t2 t3` for each ring r[X] from r19 down to r1
	* `rotateTower t1 t3 t2` (adapted for each ring's move)
	* `move_abstract t1 t3` (adapted for each ring's move, with tower adjustments)
5. `exchange t1 t2 t3` (Finalize tower positions after all rings are moved)
6. **Multiple `move` actions** (Implicit in `move_abstract` and `exchange`, explicitly moving each ring r1 to r20 to their goal positions on t3, in reverse order, r20 to r1)

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**
```
root 0
0 solve_tower_problem -> m-shiftTower 1
1 shiftTower t1 t2 t3 -> 
  m-shiftTower 2
  selectedDirection r20 t1 t2 t3 3
2 m-shiftTower (Recursive Application for each ring r19 to r1)
  -> [Recursive Application of:
     m-selectDirection for each ring
     m-rotateTower for each ring's move
     newMethod21 (move_abstract) for each ring's move]
3 selectedDirection r20 t1 t2 t3 -> 
  m-rotateTower t1 t3 t2 4
4 m-rotateTower t1 t3 t2 -> 
  newMethod21 (move_abstract) t1 t3 5
  exchange t1 t2 t3 6
5 newMethod21 (move_abstract) t1 t3 -> 
  **Implicit move actions for t1 to t3**
6 exchange t1 t2 t3 -> 
  **Method exchangeClear, exchangeLR, or exchangeRL** (depending on preconditions)
  **Implicit in exchange: multiple move actions to finalize ring positions**
```

**Note:**
- The plan's complexity and the recursive nature of the solution for each ring make it challenging to represent every single step explicitly. The provided plan focuses on key actions and their ordering, summarizing the recursive application for brevity.
- The actual execution would involve a detailed expansion of the recursive block, applying the methods for each of the 20 rings, which is not fully enumerated here due to space constraints.
- The `move` actions are implicit in the `move_abstract` and `exchange` methods, as these are the primitive actions that ultimately move the rings to their goal positions.
