**Note:**

* The sequential plan consists of 44 actions, but due to space constraints, only the first and last actions are shown.
* The hierarchical decomposition is partial, focusing on the initial `shiftTower` task and a few instances of `exchange`. The `solve_elevator` task is mentioned but not further decomposed, as its decomposition is not provided in the given HTN domain.
* Method names (e.g., `m-shiftTower`, `selectedDirection`) are used to indicate the application of a specific method for task decomposition.
* Task and method parameters are omitted for brevity, but they can be inferred from the HTN domain definition.
* The plan assumes that the HTN planner successfully resolves the tasks and methods according to the provided domain and problem definitions.
