**Note:**

* The plan is quite long, so I've omitted some of the intermediate steps for brevity. The ellipsis (`...`) indicates where the plan continues with similar tasks.
* The numbers on the left (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.) represent the sequential plan, where each number corresponds to an action or a method call.
* The `root 0` section indicates the start of the hierarchical decomposition.
* Each method call (e.g., `m7_get_soil_data`, `m1_do_navigate1`, etc.) is followed by the task parameters and the subtasks (if any).
* Actions (e.g., `sample_soil`, `drop`, `communicate_soil_data2`, etc.) are marked as `(action)` to indicate that they are primitive actions with no further decomposition.
