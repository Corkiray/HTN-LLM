Note: The plan provided is a sequential plan, where each action is executed one after the other. The hierarchical decomposition is represented by the `root` section, which shows how the top-level task `solve_problem` is decomposed into smaller sub-tasks using various methods (e.g., `m7_get_soil_data`, `m10_get_rock_data`, `m13_get_image_data`).

**Assumptions and Simplifications:**

1. **Single Rover**: The plan is generated assuming only one rover (`rover0`) is available to perform all tasks.
2. **No Resource Conflicts**: The plan does not consider potential resource conflicts, such as multiple tasks requiring the same camera or store at the same time.
3. **Simplified Navigation**: The plan uses `navigate` actions to move the rover between waypoints, assuming a direct path is always available.
4. **No Error Handling**: The plan does not include error handling or contingency actions in case of failures or unexpected events.
5. **Method Selection**: The plan selects methods (e.g., `m7_get_soil_data`) based on a simple matching of task parameters, without considering other factors like optimality or resource utilization.
