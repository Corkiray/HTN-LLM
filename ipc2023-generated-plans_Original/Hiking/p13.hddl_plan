**Sequential Plan**
1. prepare_trip place0
2. trip_to1 couple0 place7
3. prepare_trip place0
4. trip_to1 couple1 place7
5. prepare_trip place0
6. trip_to1 couple2 place7
7. prepare_trip place0
8. trip_to1 couple3 place7

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
root 0
0 everyone_go_hiking place7 -> m14_everyone_go_hiking 1 2
  1 prepare_trip place0 -> m6_prepare_trip 3 4
    3 bring_tent place0 -> m9_bring_tent (tent0) / m10_bring_tent (tent2) / m9_bring_tent (tent3)
      *tent0, tent3: m9_bring_tent (no further decomposition, already at place0 and down)
      *tent2: m10_bring_tent 
        10 put_down guy2 place0 tent2
    4 bring_cars place0 -> m11_bring_cars (multiple cars, no further decomposition)
  2 trip_to1 couple0 place7 -> m0_trip_to1 5 (similar for couple1, couple2, couple3)
    5 trip_to2 couple0 place0 place7 -> m2_trip_to2 6 (recursive, until?from =?to)
      6 trip_to2 couple0 place0 place1 -> m2_trip_to2 7 (next recursive step, omitted for brevity)
        *eventually leads to m3_trip_to2 for each couple (e.g., couple0, place6 to place7)
          20 drive_tent guy0 place6 place7 car0 tent0
          21 drive guy1 place6 place7 car1
          22 put_up guy0 place7 tent0
          23 drive_passenger girl0 place7 place6 car1 guy1
          24 walk_everyone tent0 place7 place6 -> m5_walk_everyone 25
            25 walk_together tent0 place7 guy0 place6 girl0 couple0
          *... (similar steps for put_down, drive_passenger, drive for each couple)
<==

**Notes:**

* The plan assumes that the `walk_everyone` task for each couple can be fulfilled by the `walk_together` action, given the `walked` predicate's initial state and the `next` predicate's definition in the problem.
* The decomposition for `bring_tent` and `bring_cars` is partially shown, focusing on the most relevant paths given the initial state. Other methods (e.g., `m7_bring_tent`, `m8_bring_tent`, `m12_bring_cars`) might be applicable based on different initial conditions not present in this problem.
* The recursive application of `m2_trip_to2` is indicated but not fully expanded due to its repetitive nature and the length of the output.
* Actions and subtasks without further decomposition (e.g., `nop`, direct applications of `m9_bring_tent`, `m11_bring_cars`) are either self-explanatory or lead to no additional actionable steps based on the provided problem's initial state.
