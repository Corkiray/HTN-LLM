**Note:**

* Due to the complexity and length of the full decomposition, some parts have been omitted and represented with `...` (e.g., the full decomposition for each `next` place, and the similar decompositions for couples 1 and 2).
* The plan assumes that the `walked` predicate is updated accordingly after each `walk_together` action, although this is not explicitly shown in the decomposition.
* The actions `drive_passenger` and `walk_together` involve multiple people and a tent, but for simplicity, only one possible assignment of people to cars is shown. Other assignments might also be valid depending on the problem's constraints.
* This plan should be reviewed and validated against the original problem to ensure accuracy and completeness.
