**Sequential Plan**
1. `flip l1 l1 N Y`
2. `flip l1 l2 Y N`
3. `flip l2 l1 N Y`
4. `flip l0 l1 N Y`
5. `flip l1 l1 N Y` (again, due to propagation)
**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 play -> do_play 1 6
1 turn -> do_turn l1 l1 N Y 2 3 4 5
2 propagate_up l1 l1 N -> propagate_up_do l1 l1 l2 N Y 7
3 propagate_down l1 l1 N -> propagate_down_end_field l1 l1 N
4 propagate_left l1 l1 N -> propagate_left_end_field l1 l1 N
5 propagate_right l1 l1 N -> propagate_right_do l1 l1 l0 N Y 8
6 play -> end_game
7 propagate_up l2 l1 N -> propagate_up_end_field l2 l1 N
8 propagate_right l0 l1 N -> propagate_right_end_different l0 l1 l1 N
```
**Explanation**

* The sequential plan consists of 5 `flip` actions to achieve the goal state.
* The hierarchical decomposition starts with the `play` task, which is decomposed into `turn` and another `play` ( recursive, but ending with `end_game` since no more changes are needed).
* The `turn` task is decomposed into `flip` (already in the sequential plan) and four propagation tasks.
* Each propagation task is further decomposed:
	+ `propagate_up` from `l1` to `l2` (since `l2` is the next coordinate), and then ends since `l2` is the maximum.
	+ `propagate_down` from `l1` ends immediately since `l1` is not the minimum.
	+ `propagate_left` from `l1` ends immediately since `l1` is not the maximum in the y-coordinate.
	+ `propagate_right` from `l1` to `l0` (since `l0` is the previous coordinate), and then ends since the status at `l0 l1` is different (already achieved by the sequential plan).

Note: The plan assumes that the `flip` action's effect is immediate and persistent, and that the propagation methods correctly handle the boundaries and different statuses as specified in the domain and problem definitions.
