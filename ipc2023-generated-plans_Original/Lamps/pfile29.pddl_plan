Given the complexity of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan manually is impractical within this format. The domain involves a game with a large grid (20x20) and rules for propagating changes (flipping statuses) in four directions, with the goal of achieving a specific configuration.

However, I can guide you through a high-level approach to solving this problem, including the initial steps of a sequential plan and the beginning of the hierarchical decomposition. Note that a full, detailed plan would require computational processing by an HTN planner.

**Sequential Plan Initiation (Simplified):**

Given the vast number of initial and goal states, we'll focus on key differences to initiate the plan.

1. **Identify Key Differences:**
   - **Initial State:** Mixed Y/N statuses across the grid.
   - **Goal State:** Specific Y/N pattern, notably with all Y on the right side and specific patterns on the left.

2. **Initial Actions (Conceptual, not exhaustive):**
   - **Action 1-5:** Flip strategically chosen cells to start aligning the left side with the goal, considering the propagation rules.
     - Example: `flip l3 l5 Y N` (This is speculative; actual actions depend on detailed analysis or planner output.)

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Partial):**

```
==>
1 flip l3 l5 Y N  # Speculative initial action to demonstrate format
2...               # Further actions based on detailed planning
...
<==

root 0
0 play -> m_do_play 1
1 turn -> m_do_turn l3 l5 Y N 2  # Decomposing 'turn' with speculative parameters
2 propagate_up l3 l5 Y -> m_propagate_up_do l3 l5 l4 Y N 3
3...                                  # Further decomposition based on planning
```

**Method Decompositions (Speculative, Partial):**

- **m_do_play:**
  - **Task:** play
  - **Subtasks:** turn, play (as per domain definition)

- **m_do_turn (Speculative for l3 l5 Y N):**
  - **Task:** turn
  - **Parameters:**?x=l3,?y=l5,?s1=Y,?s2=N
  - **Subtasks:**
    - flip l3 l5 Y N
    - propagate_up l3 l5 Y
    -... (other propagations)

- **m_propagate_up_do (Speculative for l3 l5 l4 Y N):**
  - **Task:** propagate_up l3 l5 Y
  - **Parameters:**?x=l3,?y=l5,?xx=l4,?s1=Y,?s2=N
  - **Subtasks:**
    - flip l4 l5 Y N
    - propagate_up l4 l5 Y

**Note:**
- The provided plan steps (`flip l3 l5 Y N`, method parameters, and decompositions) are **highly speculative** and used only to illustrate the format. Actual planning requires running the HTN domain and problem through an HTN planner.
- The complexity of the domain and the vast state space mean that manual planning is not feasible here. An HTN planner would systematically explore the space, applying the domain's rules to generate a valid plan.
