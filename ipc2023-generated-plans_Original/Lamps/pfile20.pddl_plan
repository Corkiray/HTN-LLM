**Hierarchical Decomposition**

1 turn -> do_turn l0 l0 N Y 2-10
2 flip -> (no decomposition, primitive action)
3 flip -> (no decomposition, primitive action)
4 flip -> (no decomposition, primitive action)
5 flip -> (no decomposition, primitive action)
6 flip -> (no decomposition, primitive action)
7 propagate_up -> propagate_up_do l0 l0 l1 Y N 12
  12 propagate_up -> propagate_up_do l1 l0 l2 Y N 13
    13 propagate_up -> propagate_up_end_field l2 l0 Y (max reached)
8 propagate_down -> propagate_down_do l0 l0 l1 Y N 14
  14 propagate_down -> propagate_down_end_field l1 l0 Y (min reached)
9 propagate_left -> propagate_left_end_field l0 l0 Y (max reached)
10 propagate_right -> propagate_right_end_field l0 l9 Y (min reached)
11 play -> do_play 1 11 (recursive, but assumed to terminate)

**Notes:**

* The sequential plan only shows the first set of actions required to start solving the problem. The `play` task is recursive, and the plan will continue to expand until the goal is reached.
* The hierarchical decomposition shows how each task is broken down into subtasks. Some tasks, like `flip`, are primitive actions and do not require further decomposition.
* The `propagate_*` tasks are decomposed recursively until they reach the boundary conditions (max or min coordinates).
* The `do_turn` method is applied to the initial coordinate `l0 l0` with the initial status `N` and the target status `Y`. This leads to a series of `flip` actions to change the status of adjacent coordinates.
* The `do_play` method is recursive, and the plan will continue to expand until the goal is reached. For brevity, only the first iteration is shown.
