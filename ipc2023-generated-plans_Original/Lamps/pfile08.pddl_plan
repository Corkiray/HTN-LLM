**Sequential Plan**
1. `flip l1 l1 Y N` (to satisfy `do_turn`'s `flip` requirement)
2. `flip l0 l2 Y N` (preparation for propagation)
3. `flip l0 l2 N Y` (to satisfy goal `(on l0 l2 Y)` and trigger propagation)
4. `flip l2 l2 N Y` (propagation right from `l0 l2`)
5. `flip l2 l1 Y N` (propagation right from `l0 l2`, to allow further propagation)
6. `flip l2 l1 N Y` (propagation right from `l0 l2`, finalizing right propagation)
7. `flip l2 l0 Y N` (propagation down from `l1 l1`, triggered by initial `flip`)
8. `flip l2 l0 N Y` (propagation down from `l1 l1`, finalizing down propagation)
9. `flip l0 l0 Y N` (to satisfy goal `(on l0 l0 N)`)
10. `flip l0 l1 Y N` (to satisfy goal `(on l0 l1 N)`)

**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 play -> do_play 1 10
1 turn -> do_turn l1 l1 Y N 1 2
  1.1 flip l1 l1 Y N
  1.2 propagate_up l1 l1 Y -> propagate_up_do l1 l1 l2 Y N 2
    2.1 flip l2 l2 Y N (not directly in sequence, but implied for propagation)
    2.2 propagate_up l2 l1 Y -> propagate_up_end_field l2 l1 Y
  1.3 propagate_down l1 l1 Y -> propagate_down_do l1 l0 Y N 3
    3.1 flip l0 l0 Y N (not directly in sequence, but implied for propagation)
    3.2 propagate_down l0 l0 Y -> propagate_down_end_field l0 l0 Y
  1.4 propagate_left l1 l1 Y -> propagate_left_end_different l1 l1 l0 Y
  1.5 propagate_right l1 l1 Y -> propagate_right_do l1 l1 l2 Y N 4
    4.1 flip l2 l2 Y N (implied, see step 2 in sequence)
    4.2 propagate_right l2 l1 Y -> propagate_right_end_different l2 l1 l0 Y
2 play -> end_game (no further actions needed, goal achieved)

**Notes:**

- The plan assumes that the `flip` action's effects are immediate and that the propagation methods are correctly handling the `next`, `max`, and `min` predicates as defined in the domain.
- Some `flip` actions (e.g., `flip l2 l2 Y N`) are implied by the propagation methods and are not directly listed in the sequential plan but are crucial for understanding the full execution flow.
- The hierarchical decomposition focuses on the primary task decompositions, omitting some of the implicit `flip` actions for brevity, as they are already accounted for in the sequential plan.
- The goal state is achieved through a combination of direct `flip` actions and the propagation effects, ensuring all specified goal conditions are met.
