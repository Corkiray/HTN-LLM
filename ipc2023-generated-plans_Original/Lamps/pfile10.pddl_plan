**Sequential Plan**
1. `flip l1 l1 Y N` (to satisfy `do_turn` precondition)
2. `turn l1 l1 N Y` (apply `do_turn` with?s1=N,?s2=Y)
3. `flip l1 l2 Y N` (propagate_up_do, recursive call)
4. `propagate_up l1 l2 N` (propagate_up_do, recursive call)
5. `flip l1 l3 Y N` (propagate_right_do, recursive call)
6. `propagate_right l1 l3 N` (propagate_right_do, recursive call)
7. `flip l0 l0 N Y` (to satisfy goal)
8. `flip l0 l1 N Y` (to satisfy goal)
9. `flip l3 l0 Y N` (to satisfy goal)
**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 play -> do_play 1 10
  1 turn -> do_turn l1 l1 Y N 2 3 4 5 6
    2 flip l1 l1 Y N
    3 propagate_up l1 l1 N -> propagate_up_do l1 l1 l2 N Y 4
      4 flip l1 l2 Y N
      4 propagate_up l1 l2 N -> propagate_up_end_field l1 l2 N
    5 propagate_down l1 l1 N -> propagate_down_end_field l1 l1 N
    6 propagate_right l1 l1 N -> propagate_right_do l1 l1 l3 N Y 7
      7 flip l1 l3 Y N
      7 propagate_right l1 l3 N -> propagate_right_end_field l1 l3 N
  10 play -> end_game
**Additional Goal-Satisfying Actions (not part of original HTN decomposition)**
8 flip l0 l0 N Y
9 flip l0 l1 N Y
10 flip l3 l0 Y N

**Note:**

* The plan assumes that the `flip` action is applicable whenever the preconditions are met, and that the effects of `flip` are as specified in the domain definition.
* The hierarchical decomposition follows the structure of the provided HTN domain, with each task decomposed into its corresponding method.
* The `do_play` method is applied recursively, but since the problem's goal is met after the first `turn`, the second `play` task is solved by the `end_game` method, which has no subtasks.
* The additional goal-satisfying actions (8-10) are not part of the original HTN decomposition but are necessary to satisfy the problem's goal. In a real HTN planner, these would be incorporated into the plan through additional task decomposition or action insertion mechanisms.
