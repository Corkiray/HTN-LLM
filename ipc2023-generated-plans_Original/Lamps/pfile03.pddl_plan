**Plan Explanation:**

1. **Initial Turn**: 
   - `turn` (1) is executed, which leads to:
     - `flip l0 l0 Y N` (3) to change the status of `l0 l0` from `Y` to `N`.
     - Four propagation tasks are initiated from `l0 l0` in all directions.

2. **Propagation Up**:
   - From `l0 l0`, moving up to `l1 l0`:
     - `flip l1 l0 Y N` (9) changes the status of `l1 l0` from `Y` to `N`.
     - `propagate_up l1 l0 Y` (10) stops as it reaches the maximum boundary (`max l1`).

3. **Propagation Down, Left, and Right**:
   - **Down**: Stops immediately at `l0 l0` since it's the minimum (`min l0`).
   - **Left**: Assuming `l0` is considered the maximum in its column in the initial state, it stops.
   - **Right**: 
     - Moves from `l0 l0` to `l0 l1`, flipping the state: `flip l0 l1 Y N` (11).
     - Further propagation to the right from `l0 l1` stops because the next cell in the direction (which would be `l1 l1` if considering a wrap-around or non-existent if not) does not match the precondition for further propagation in this specific implementation context.

4. **Subsequent Play**:
   - The plan ends with `play` (2) being solved by `end_game`, indicating no further actions are planned beyond the initial turn and its propagations.

**Note**: The plan's effectiveness in achieving the goal state depends on the domain's specifics, especially the `next` and boundary predicates. This solution assumes a straightforward interpretation of the given HTN domain and problem. The actual outcome might vary based on the planner's capabilities and the domain's nuances not explicitly covered here.
