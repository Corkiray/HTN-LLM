**Sequential Plan**
1. `turn` (initial turn to start the game)
2. `flip l1 l1 Y N` (flip cell (l1,l1) from Y to N)
3. `flip l2 l2 N Y` (flip cell (l2,l2) from N to Y)
4. `flip l2 l1 N Y` (flip cell (l2,l1) from N to Y)
5. `flip l3 l2 Y N` (flip cell (l3,l2) from Y to N)
6. `flip l4 l4 Y N` (flip cell (l4,l4) from Y to N)
7. `play` (continue playing after initial turns)
**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 play -> do_play 1 7
1 turn -> do_turn l1 l1 Y N 2 3 4 5 6
  2 propagate_up l1 l1 l2 Y N -> propagate_up_do l1 l1 l2 Y N 8
    8 propagate_up l2 l1 l3 Y N -> propagate_up_end_different l2 l1 l3 Y N
  3 propagate_down l1 l1 l0 Y N -> propagate_down_do l1 l1 l0 Y N 9
    9 propagate_down l0 l1 l0 Y N -> propagate_down_end_field l0 l1 Y N
  4 propagate_left l1 l1 l1 l0 Y N -> propagate_left_end_different l1 l1 l1 l0 Y N
  5 propagate_right l1 l1 l1 l2 Y N -> propagate_right_do l1 l1 l1 l2 Y N 10
    10 propagate_right l1 l2 l1 l3 Y N -> propagate_right_end_different l1 l2 l1 l3 Y N
  6 propagate_right l1 l1 l1 l4 Y N -> propagate_right_end_field l1 l1 l4 Y N
7 play -> end_game
```
**Note:**

* The sequential plan lists the actions to achieve the goal, with `turn` initiating the game, followed by specific `flip` actions to change the cell statuses as needed, and finally `play` to continue the game after these initial changes.
* The hierarchical decomposition breaks down the tasks:
	+ `play` is decomposed into `do_play`, which involves an initial `turn` followed by continuing to `play`.
	+ The first `turn` is decomposed into `do_turn`, which includes flipping a cell and propagating changes in all four directions (up, down, left, right).
	+ Each propagation direction (e.g., `propagate_up`) is further decomposed based on the conditions (e.g., `propagate_up_do` if the next cell is in the same status, or ending the propagation if reaching the field's end or encountering a different status).
	+ The second instance of `play` (after the initial turns) is decomposed into `end_game`, indicating no further actions are planned in this solution.
