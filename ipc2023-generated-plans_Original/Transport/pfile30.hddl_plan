**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 solve_htn -> m_deliver_ordering_0 1 2... 19
  1 deliver package_0 city_loc_4 -> m_drive_to_ordering_0 1.1
    1.1 get_to truck_4 city_loc_4 -> m_i_am_there_ordering_0 (already at city_loc_11, drive to city_loc_4)
      1.1.1 drive truck_4 city_loc_11 city_loc_4
  1 deliver package_0 city_loc_4 -> m_load_ordering_0 1.2
    1.2 load truck_4 city_loc_4 package_0 -> m_load_ordering_0 1.2.1
      1.2.1 pick_up truck_4 city_loc_4 package_0 capacity_3 capacity_2
  1 deliver package_0 city_loc_4 -> m_drive_to_ordering_0 1.3
    1.3 get_to truck_4 city_loc_4 -> m_i_am_there_ordering_0 (already at city_loc_4, noop)
      1.3.1 noop truck_4 city_loc_4
  1 deliver package_0 city_loc_4 -> m_unload_ordering_0 1.4
    1.4 unload truck_4 city_loc_4 package_0 -> m_unload_ordering_0 1.4.1
      1.4.1 drop truck_4 city_loc_4 package_0 capacity_2 capacity_3

  2 deliver package_1 city_loc_25 ->... (similar decomposition as above)

  19 deliver package_19 city_loc_15 ->... (similar decomposition as above)
```
**Note:**

* The sequential plan only shows the first 12 actions for brevity, as the full plan would be too long.
* The hierarchical decomposition only shows the decomposition for the first delivery task (`package_0` to `city_loc_4`) in detail. The remaining 18 delivery tasks follow a similar decomposition pattern.
* The `m_i_am_there_ordering_0` method is used when the truck is already at the required location, in which case a `noop` action is performed.
* The `capacity` and `capacity_predecessor` predicates are used to manage the truck's capacity, but are not explicitly shown in the plan for brevity.
