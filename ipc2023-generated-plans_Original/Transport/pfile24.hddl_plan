**Note:**
- The sequential plan is truncated to focus on the first two deliveries for brevity. The full plan would include actions for all 14 deliveries, totaling 121 actions.
- The hierarchical decomposition shows how the top-level `solve_htn` task is decomposed into `deliver` tasks, which are further broken down into `get_to`, `load`, `get_to` (again for the destination), and `unload` tasks. The methods used for decomposition (e.g., `m_deliver_ordering_0`, `m_drive_to_ordering_0`, etc.) are as defined in the provided HTN domain.
- The actions listed under each decomposition step (e.g., `drive`, `pick_up`, `noop`, etc.) are the primitive actions that achieve the tasks, as per the domain's action definitions.
