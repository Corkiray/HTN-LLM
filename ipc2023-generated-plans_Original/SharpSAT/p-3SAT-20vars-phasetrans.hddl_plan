Given the complexity of the SharpSAT domain and the specific problem instance provided, generating a complete, step-by-step hierarchical plan manually is impractical due to the vast number of possible branches and the depth of the search space. However, I can outline the general structure of how a plan might be approached, using the format you've requested for the initial steps, and then describe how the plan would unfold at a higher level.

**Initial Plan Steps (Sequential Portion):**
```
==>
1. (count-models n0)  // Start with the top-level task to count models at decision level 0
<==
```

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Starting with `root 0`):**
```
root 0
0 count-models n0 -> m_count-models_split n0 n1 n85 l11p l11n n0 n0  // Assuming no unit clauses initially, we split
  // Parameters:?d?dplusone - number?clausecount - number?l?lneg - literal?nposoccs?nnegoccs - number
  // Note: The choice of `l11p` and `l11n` is arbitrary for this example; in practice, a heuristic would guide this choice.
  
  // Subtasks of m_count-models_split (simplified for brevity, focusing on key actions):
  1. A_MARK_VAR_ASSIGNED l11p l11n
  2. propagate-same-polarity l11p n1
  3. propagate-opposite-polarity l11n n1
  4. count-models n1  // Recurse at the next decision level
  5. backtrack-opposite-polarity l11n n1
  6. backtrack-same-polarity l11p n1
  7. A_UNMARK_VAR_ASSIGNED l11p l11n
  
  // The plan would then recursively decompose each of these tasks, especially focusing on:
  // - propagate-same-polarity and propagate-opposite-polarity, which would further decompose based on clause lengths and satisfiability.
  // - count-models at the next decision level (n1), which might invoke m_count-models_split again, m_count-models_unit-clause, or m_count-models_empty-formula depending on the updated problem state.
  
  // For brevity and due to the complexity, the detailed decomposition of each subtask is not fully elaborated here.
  // Each of the propagate, backtrack, and recursive count-models tasks would be decomposed into more specific actions (e.g., A_SATISFY_CLAUSE, A_UPDATE_CLAUSE_LENGTH) based on the problem's state and the method's preconditions.
```

**Higher-Level Plan Unfolding:**

- **Propagation Steps:**
  - For each literal's polarity, propagate through clauses, satisfying or reducing them as appropriate.
  - This involves marking clauses as satisfied (if they become unit and are satisfied by the current assignment) or reducing clause lengths (if a literal is eliminated).

- **Backtracking Steps:**
  - Undo the effects of propagation for the opposite polarity of the chosen literal.
  - Restore clause lengths and satisfiability as needed.

- **Recursive Counting:**
  - If a unit clause is encountered, apply the unit clause rule and recurse.
  - If all clauses are satisfied, output an exponential count for the current decision level and backtrack.
  - Otherwise, split on another variable, repeating the process.

- **Base Cases:**
  - **Empty Formula:** All clauses satisfied; output exponential count.
  - **Empty Clause:** Formula is unsatisfiable; contribute 0 to the model count.

**Note:** The actual plan generation would require executing the HTN planner with the provided domain and problem as inputs, which would systematically explore the search space based on the defined tasks, methods, and actions, and their respective preconditions and effects. The output would be a detailed, step-by-step plan to solve the given #SAT problem instance.
