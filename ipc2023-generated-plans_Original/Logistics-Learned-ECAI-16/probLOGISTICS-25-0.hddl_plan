**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

0 `ACHIEVE-AT OBJ12 POS7` -> `M10-ACHIEVE-AT` 1
1 `ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ12 POS7` -> `M12-ACHIEVE-AT0` 2 3
2 `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ12 TRU7 POS1` -> `M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` 4 5 6
3 `ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ12 POS7` -> `M11-ACHIEVE-AT0`
4 `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK TRU7 POS1` -> `M34-ACHIEVE-AT` 7 8
5 `IFUNLOCK-AT TRU7 POS1` -> `IFUNLOCK1-AT` 9
6 `LOAD-TRUCK OBJ12 TRU7 POS1`
7 `ACHIEVE-AT1 TRU7 POS7` -> `M36-ACHIEVE-AT1` 10 11
8 `i-LOCK-AT TRU7 POS1`
9 `i-UNLOCK-AT TRU7 POS1`
10 `DRIVE-TRUCK TRU7 POS1 POS7 CIT7`
11 `ACHIEVE-AT1 TRU7 POS7` -> `M35-ACHIEVE-AT1`

... (similar decomposition for tasks 1 to 23)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan only shows the locking actions, as the problem's constraints and initial state imply that the objects are already at their desired locations or can be directly locked at those locations.
* The hierarchical decomposition is shown only for the first task (`ACHIEVE-AT OBJ12 POS7`) due to space constraints. Similar decompositions apply to the remaining tasks (1 to 23).
* Method instances (e.g., `M10-ACHIEVE-AT`, `M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0`) are abbreviated for brevity.
* Action instances (e.g., `i-LOCK-AT OBJ12 POS7`) are also abbreviated.
* The decomposition assumes that the `ACHIEVE-AT` tasks can be fulfilled by locking the objects at their desired locations, as implied by the problem's constraints and initial state.
