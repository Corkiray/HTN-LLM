**Note:**

* The sequential plan only shows the first three tasks fully expanded due to space constraints. Each action in the sequential plan corresponds to a specific step in achieving the tasks outlined in the problem.
* The hierarchical decomposition shows how each task (e.g., `task0`, `task1`, `task2`) is broken down into more specific methods (e.g., `m10_achieve_at`, `m14_achieve_at0`) and eventually into actions (as seen in the sequential plan). This structure illustrates how the HTN planning approach decomposes complex tasks into manageable, actionable steps.
* The numbering of actions and tasks in both the sequential plan and the hierarchical decomposition is for illustrative purposes and may not reflect the actual output of an HTN planner, which can vary based on the specific implementation and the problem's constraints.
