**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

**root** 0
0 **ACHIEVE-AT** -> **M10-ACHIEVE-AT** 1-22

**1-22** (each **ACHIEVE-AT** task decomposes similarly, showing one as an example)

1 **ACHIEVE-AT** `OBJ81` `APT1` -> **M10-ACHIEVE-AT** 
    * **Precondition:** `(not (LOCKED-AT OBJ81 APT1)) (not (AT OBJ81 APT1))`
    * **Subtasks:**
        1.1 **ACHIEVE-AT0** `OBJ81` `APT1` -> **M12-ACHIEVE-AT0** (since `OBJ81` is not at `APT1` but at `POS8`)
            * **Precondition:** `(not (AT OBJ81 APT1)) (AT OBJ81 POS8)`
            * **Subtasks:**
                1.1.1 **DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0** `OBJ81` `TRU8` `POS8` -> **M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0**
                    * **Precondition:** `(AT OBJ81 POS8)`
                    * **Subtasks:**
                        1.1.1.1 **ACHIEVE-AT-TRK** `TRU8` `POS8` -> **M34-ACHIEVE-AT** 
                            * **Precondition:** `(not (LOCKED-AT TRU8 POS8)) (not (AT TRU8 POS8))`
                            * **Subtasks:**
                                1.1.1.1.1 **ACHIEVE-AT1** `TRU8` `POS8` -> **M36-ACHIEVE-AT1** (assuming `TRU8` is in a different location within the same city)
                                    * **Precondition:** `(not (AT TRU8 POS8)) (AT TRU8?PLACE3) (IN-CITY?PLACE3 CIT8) (IN-CITY POS8 CIT8)`
                                    * **Subtasks:**
                                        1.1.1.1.1.1 **DRIVE-TRUCK** `TRU8` `?PLACE3` `POS8` `CIT8`
                                        1.1.1.1.1.2 **ACHIEVE-AT1** `TRU8` `POS8`
                                1.1.1.1.2 **i-LOCK-AT** `TRU8` `POS8`
                        1.1.1.2 **i-UNLOCK-AT** `TRU8` `POS8`
                        1.1.1.3 **LOAD-TRUCK** `OBJ81` `TRU8` `POS8`
                1.1.2 **ACHIEVE-AT0** `OBJ81` `APT1` ( recursive call, omitted for brevity)

**Note:**

* The sequential plan only shows the locking actions for each object at its target location, as the problem's constraints and initial state suggest that the objects are not initially locked.
* The hierarchical decomposition focuses on one example task (`ACHIEVE-AT OBJ81 APT1`) to illustrate the method application. Each of the 22 **ACHIEVE-AT** tasks would similarly decompose based on their specific circumstances (e.g., current location, locked status).
* The decomposition assumes the planner selects methods based on the preconditions being met. The actual plan might vary based on the planner's strategy and the domain's specifics (e.g., the availability of trucks, the current location of trucks and objects, etc.).
* Actions and subtasks without preconditions or with trivial preconditions (always true) are not explicitly listed for brevity.
* The `?PLACE3` in some preconditions indicates a variable that would be bound to a specific location during planning, based on the city and the truck's current location.
