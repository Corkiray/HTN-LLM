**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

**root 0**
0 **ACHIEVE-AT** -> **M10-ACHIEVE-AT** 1 2... 29
	* **task0 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ33 POS3)**
	+ 1 **i-LOCK-AT OBJ33 POS3**
	+ 2 **ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ33 POS3** (noop, already at POS3)
	* **task1 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ22 POS3)**
	+ 3 **i-LOCK-AT OBJ22 POS3**
	+ 4 **ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ22 POS3** (noop, already at POS3)
	*...
	* **task13 (ACHIEVE-AT OBJ21 POS4)**
	+ 28 **i-LOCK-AT OBJ21 POS4**
	+ 29 **ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ21 POS4** (noop, already at POS4)

**M10-ACHIEVE-AT** (and many others) are method instances, where:
* **M10-ACHIEVE-AT**: Achieve `AT?PACKAGE0?PLACE1` when not locked and not at the place
	+ Subtasks: **ACHIEVE-AT0** (move to the place) and **i-LOCK-AT** (lock at the place)
* **ACHIEVE-AT0**: Move `?PACKAGE0` to `?PLACE1` when not already there
	+ Subtasks vary depending on the method instance (e.g., **DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0**, **DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0**, **DRIVE-TRUCK**, **FLY-AIRPLANE**)

Note: This plan assumes the problem's constraints and initial state are correctly represented. The plan's correctness relies on the HTN domain and problem definitions.
