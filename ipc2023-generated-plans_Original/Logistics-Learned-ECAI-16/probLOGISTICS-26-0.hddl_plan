**Hierarchical Decomposition**
```
root 0
0 ACHIEVE-AT OBJ43 POS4 -> M10-ACHIEVE-AT 1 2 3
  1 ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ43 POS4 -> M12-ACHIEVE-AT0 4 5 6 (since OBJ43 is not at POS4, but at POS4 initially)
    4 DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ43 TRU4 POS4 -> M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 7 8 9 (assuming TRU4 is available)
      7 ACHIEVE-AT-TRK TRU4 POS4 -> M33-ACHIEVE-AT 10 11 (since TRU4 is at POS4)
        10 i-LOCK-AT TRU4 POS4
        11 i-FLAG-AT TRU4 POS4
      8 IFUNLOCK-AT TRU4 POS4 -> IFUNLOCK1-AT 12

      9 LOAD-TRUCK OBJ43 TRU4 POS4
    5 ACHIEVE-AT0 OBJ43 POS4 -> (noop, already achieved)
    6 i-LOCK-AT OBJ43 POS4
  2 ACHIEVE-AT OBJ71 POS7 -> M10-ACHIEVE-AT... (similar decomposition)
  3 ACHIEVE-AT OBJ52 POS2 -> M10-ACHIEVE-AT... (similar decomposition)

25. ACHIEVE-AT OBJ93 APT2 -> M39-ACHIEVE-AT 26 27 28
  26 ACHIEVE-AT2 APN2 APT2 -> M41-ACHIEVE-AT2 29 30 (assuming APN2 is at APT6, and APT6 is in the same city as APT2)
    29 FLY-AIRPLANE APN2 APT6 APT2
    30 ACHIEVE-AT2 APN2 APT2 -> (noop, already achieved)

```
**Note:**

* The decomposition only shows a subset of the tasks (1-3 and 25) to illustrate the hierarchical structure. The remaining tasks (4-24) would follow a similar decomposition pattern.
* The method selection is based on the preconditions and the initial state. For example, `M10-ACHIEVE-AT` is chosen for `ACHIEVE-AT OBJ43 POS4` because `OBJ43` is not at `POS4`, but the method requires `OBJ43` to be at some location, which is the case (`POS4` initially).
* The action parameters (e.g., `TRU4` in `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0 OBJ43 TRU4 POS4`) are assumed to be correctly instantiated based on the problem's initial state and the method's preconditions.
* The `noop` (no operation) indicates that the task is already achieved, and no further actions are required.
