**Sequential Plan:**

1. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ13` `POS1`
2. `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `POS1`
3. `ACHIEVE-AT1` `TRU1` `APT6`
4. `DRIVE-TRUCK` `TRU1` `POS1` `POS6` `CIT6`
5. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `APT6`
6. `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ32` `POS3`
7. `DO-AT-LOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ32` `APN2` `POS3`
8. `ACHIEVE-AT2` `APN2` `APT5`
9. `FLY-AIRPLANE` `APN2` `APT6` `APT5`
10. `DO-IN-UNLOAD-AIRPLANE0` `OBJ32` `APN2` `APT5`
...
**Plan truncated for brevity, tasks 2-17 will follow a similar pattern**

**Hierarchical Decomposition:**

`root` `0`
`0` `ACHIEVE-AT` `OBJ13` `APT6` -> `M10-ACHIEVE-AT` `1` `2` `3` `4` `5`
`1` `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ13` `APT6` -> `M12-ACHIEVE-AT0` `6` `7` `8` 
`2` `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ13` `POS1` 
`3` `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `POS1` -> `M4-DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `9` `10` `11`
`4` `ACHIEVE-AT1` `TRU1` `APT6` -> `M36-ACHIEVE-AT1` `12` `13`
`5` `DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `APT6` -> `M6-DO-IN-UNLOAD-TRUCK0` `14` `15` `16`
`6` `DO-AT-LOAD-TRUCK0` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `POS1` (as above)
`7` `ACHIEVE-AT0` `OBJ13` `APT6` (as above)
`8` `i-LOCK-AT` `OBJ13` `APT6` 
`9` `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK` `TRU1` `POS1` -> `M35-ACHIEVE-AT1` `17`
`10` `IFUNLOCK-AT` `TRU1` `POS1` -> `IFUNLOCK1-AT` `18`
`11` `LOAD-TRUCK` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `POS1` 
`12` `DRIVE-TRUCK` `TRU1` `POS1` `POS6` `CIT6` 
`13` `ACHIEVE-AT1` `TRU1` `APT6` (as above)
`14` `ACHIEVE-AT-TRK` `TRU1` `APT6` (as above)
`15` `IFUNLOCK-AT` `TRU1` `APT6` (as above)
`16` `UNLOAD-TRUCK` `OBJ13` `TRU1` `APT6` 
`17` `i-LOCK-AT` `TRU1` `POS1` 
`18` `i-UNLOCK-AT` `TRU1` `POS1` 

**Tasks 2-17 will have similar decompositions, adapting to their specific locations, vehicles, and packages.**
