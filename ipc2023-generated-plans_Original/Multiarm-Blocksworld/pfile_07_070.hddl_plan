Given the complexity of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan here is impractical due to the sheer size of the problem (involving 70 blocks and 7 arms) and the limitations of this format. However, I can guide you through a high-level approach to solving it, including a simplified example of how the hierarchical plan might start. Please note, the actual plan generation would typically be done using an HTN planner, which can systematically decompose tasks into more manageable subtasks until reaching executable actions.

### High-Level Approach:

1. **Initialize**: Start with the initial state and goal as defined in the problem.
2. **Task Decomposition**:
   - Begin with the top-level task: `(achieve-goals armX)` for each arm.
   - Apply relevant methods from the domain to decompose these tasks into more specific subtasks (e.g., `pickup_ready_block`, `unstack_block`, `release-stack`, etc.) based on the current state and goals.
   - Continue decomposing subtasks until reaching primitive actions (e.g., `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`).
3. **Action Sequencing**: Once all tasks are decomposed into actions, sequence them to achieve the goals, ensuring that the preconditions for each action are met by the effects of previous actions.

### Simplified Example of Initial Plan Decomposition:

**==>**
**Sequential Plan (High-Level, Incomplete due to Problem Size)**
1. `achieve-goals arm1`
2. `achieve-goals arm2`
...
7. `achieve-goals arm7`

**<==**

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Simplified, Focusing on `arm1` and a Single Goal)**
```plaintext
root 0
0 achieve-goals arm1 -> m1_go_ordering_0 1
1 deliver-block-to-goal b40 b23 arm1 -> m2_ordering_0 2 3
2 unstack-block b40?b?d arm1 (Identify?b and?d based on initial state and goal)
3 release-stack b40 b23 arm1

# Further Decomposition of 'unstack-block' and'release-stack' would follow,
# eventually leading to primitive actions like 'pickup','stack', etc.
# The '?' in '?b?d' would be replaced with actual block identifiers based on the problem's initial state and goals.
```

**Actual Plan Generation**:
To generate a complete, detailed plan, you would use an HTN planner, feeding it the provided domain and problem files. The planner would systematically apply the methods to decompose tasks, ensuring that the preconditions for each selected method (and eventually each action) are satisfied, leading to a sequence of actions that achieve the problem's goals.

**Tools for HTN Planning**:
- **SHOP2**: A well-known HTN planner that can be used for this purpose.
- **HTN Planner in PDDL**: If you're familiar with PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language), some PDDL planners support HTN planning or can be adapted for it.

**Note**: The complexity of the problem (70 blocks, 7 arms, and intricate goal setup) means that:
- Manual planning is highly impractical.
- The output plan would be extremely lengthy, far exceeding the space available here.
- The use of automated planning tools is essential for solving such complex HTN problems efficiently.
