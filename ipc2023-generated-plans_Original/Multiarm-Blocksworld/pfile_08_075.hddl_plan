Given the complexity of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan here is impractical due to the sheer size of the problem (involving 75 blocks and 8 arms) and the limitations of this format. However, I can guide you through a high-level, simplified hierarchical plan, focusing on the structure and key steps for achieving the goals. This will not include every single action (e.g., `mark_done`, `delete_goal_on`, etc.) but will outline the main tasks and their decompositions.

**Sequential Plan (High-Level Overview):**

1. **Initialize Arms**: Ensure all arms are empty and ready for tasks.
2. **Achieve Block Stacking Goals**: This involves multiple, interleaved tasks for each arm to stack blocks according to the goal state.
3. **Finalize and Verify**: Once all blocks are in their desired positions, mark each block as done and verify the goal state is achieved.

**Hierarchical Decomposition (Simplified):**

```

**Sequential Plan Steps with Hierarchical Decomposition**
1. Initialize Arms
2. Achieve Block Stacking Goals
   root 0
   0 achieve-goals arm1 -> m1_arm1_stack_achieve 2.1, 2.2,..., 2.n
  ...
   7 achieve-goals arm8 -> m8_arm8_stack_achieve 2.1, 2.2,..., 2.n

**root 0 Decomposition for arm1 (Similar for arm2-8)**
0 achieve-goals arm1
  -> m1_pickup_ready_blocks 1.1, 1.2 (for blocks needing direct pickup)
  -> m1_unstack_blocks 1.3, 1.4 (for blocks needing unstacking first)
  -> m1_release_stack 1.5, 1.6 (for blocks to be stacked)
  -> m1_release_table 1.7 (for blocks to be placed on the table)

**Further Decomposition Example for m1_pickup_ready_blocks**
1.1 pickup_ready_blocks bX arm1
  -> newMethod13 bX arm1
    -> pickup bX arm1

**Example for Stacking (m1_release_stack)**
1.5 release_stack bY bZ arm1
  -> newMethod15 bY bZ arm1
    -> stack bY bZ arm1

3. Finalize and Verify
  -> set_done arm1, arm2,..., arm8
<==
```

**Key:**

- `mX_method_name`: Method invocation for arm X, method name (e.g., `m1_pickup_ready_blocks` for arm1).
- `newMethodXY`: Primitive action methods (e.g., `newMethod13` for `pickup`).
- `X.Y`: Task or action step (e.g., `1.1` for the first task of achieving goals with arm1).
- `bX`, `bY`, `bZ`: Placeholder block identifiers.
- `armX`: Placeholder arm identifier.

**Note:**
- This plan is highly simplified and condensed. Actual planning would require expanding each method invocation into its respective tasks and actions, considering the initial state, goal state, and the preconditions/effects of each action.
- The plan assumes the planner can handle the complexity of interleaving tasks across multiple arms efficiently, ensuring no conflicts (e.g., two arms trying to move the same block simultaneously).
- Implementing a planner to generate and execute such a plan would typically involve programming languages like Python, using planning libraries or frameworks (e.g., PDDL, PyHop, or dedicated HTN planners).
