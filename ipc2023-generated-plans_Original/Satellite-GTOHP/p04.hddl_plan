```
**Notes:**

1. **Task2 (do_mission Star6 infrared3)**: There is no instrument on satellite4 that supports infrared3 for Star6. This task cannot be completed with the current setup.
2. **take_image actions**: There are no direct methods defined for the take_image actions in the provided HTN domain. It is assumed that these actions are directly applicable.
3. **turn_to actions**: The turn_to actions are used to satisfy the do_turning tasks. The actual turn_to actions are listed in the sequential plan, while the hierarchical decomposition references the do_turning tasks.
4. **Instrument selection**: The plan assumes that the instruments are selected based on their support for the required modes and the availability on the satellite. In some cases, the instrument selection is not explicitly stated in the hierarchical decomposition, as it is assumed to be part of the take_image action.
