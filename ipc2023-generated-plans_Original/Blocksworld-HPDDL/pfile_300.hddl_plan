Given the complexity and size of the provided HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) domain and problem, generating a complete, step-by-step plan to solve it manually is impractical within this format. The problem involves 300 blocks with specific goal states (e.g., `on`, `on-table`, `clear`) that need to be achieved through a series of actions (e.g., `pickup`, `putdown`, `stack`, `unstack`) and higher-level tasks (e.g., `achieve-goals`, `release`, `putdown_abstract`, `stack_abstract`, `acquire_abstract`).

However, I can guide you through a high-level approach on how one might start decomposing the problem using the provided HTN methods, and then provide a highly simplified, partial example of what the beginning of a plan might look like. Note that a full solution would require computational tools designed for HTN planning due to the problem's scale.

### High-Level Approach:

1. **Identify Initial and Goal States**: Already provided in the problem statement.
2. **Apply `achieve-goals` Method**:
   - This involves selecting appropriate methods to achieve the goal states. Given methods like `mark-done-table`, `mark-done-on`, `pickup-ready-block`, `unstack-block`, and others, the planner must choose based on the goal and current state.
3. **Decompose Chosen Methods into Subtasks**:
   - For example, if `pickup-ready-block` is chosen, it might decompose into `acquire_abstract` followed by `release`.
   - Further decomposition might involve primitive actions like `pickup` for `acquire_abstract`.
4. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Continue applying methods and decomposing tasks until all goals are met or it's determined that the problem cannot be solved with the given methods and actions.

### Simplified Partial Plan Example:

**Assumptions for this example**:
- We focus on achieving a single goal to demonstrate the format: `(on b1 b68)`.
- We assume `b1` and `b68` are clear and `b1` is not on `b68` initially.
- We simplify the decomposition process for illustrative purposes.

**Partial Plan**:
```
==>
1 pickup b1
2 unstack b68 (assuming b68 is stacked and needs to be clear)
3 stack b1 b68
4 mark_done b1 (assuming this is necessary after achieving the on relation)

root 0
0 achieve-goals -> m1_pickup_ready_block_0 1 2 3 4
  # Method to achieve (on b1 b68) by picking up b1 and stacking it on b68
  # Assuming m1_pickup_ready_block_0 is a custom method for this specific goal

1 acquire_abstract b1 -> newMethod9 1
  # Decomposing acquire_abstract into pickup action

2 unstack_block b68 -> (Assumed primitive action for simplicity)
  # In a real plan, this would be further decomposed if necessary

3 stack_abstract b1 b68 -> newMethod11 3
  # Decomposing stack_abstract into stack action

4 mark_done b1 -> (Assumed primitive action for simplicity)
  # Marking b1 as done after achieving its goal state
<==
```

**Note**: This example is **highly simplified** and **incomplete**. A real plan for the entire problem would involve:
- Addressing all goal states, not just `(on b1 b68)`.
- Properly applying all relevant HTN methods based on the initial and goal states.
- Full decomposition into primitive actions where necessary.
- Handling potential conflicts or dependencies between tasks.

**Solution**: Due to the complexity, solving this problem accurately requires utilizing HTN planning software or tools that can process the domain and problem files to generate a comprehensive plan.
