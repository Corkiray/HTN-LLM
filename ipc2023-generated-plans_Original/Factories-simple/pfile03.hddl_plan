    **Note:** This decomposition assumes the production of `resource_f_2_0` involves `factory_0` and `resource_0`. However, the direct link to `factory_0` and `resource_0` for producing `resource_f_2_0` is not explicitly provided in the problem statement or the plan. The actual method parameters and subtasks might vary based on the correct interpretation of the domain and problem.

        (skipped, as the direct get_resource for resource_f_2_0 and resource_0 are not in the plan, but implied through the production of resource_f_2_1)
    )
    **Note:** Similar to root 3, this assumes the involvement of `resource_f_2_0` and `resource_0` in the production of `resource_f_2_1`. The exact decomposition might differ based on the precise requirements for `resource_f_2_1`.

    :ordered-subtasks (and 
        1 goto location_2 (implied, for the truck to be at the right location for pickup)
        (skipped, pickup resource_2 location_2, as it's not explicitly shown but implied)
        1 goto last_location (implied, as part of the deliver action)
        (skipped, drop resource_2 last_location, as it's not explicitly shown but implied)
    )

**Notes:**

- Some actions (like `construct`, `pickup`, `drop`, and specific `produce` actions) are implied in the plan but not explicitly listed. This is because the provided plan focuses on the higher-level tasks and their decompositions.
- The decompositions for producing `resource_f_2_0` and getting `resource_f_2_1` involve assumptions due to the lack of explicit connections in the provided plan and problem statement. These might need adjustments based on the precise domain and problem requirements.
- The `goto` actions are sometimes implied as part of other actions (e.g., `deliver_resource`) and not explicitly decomposed here for brevity, assuming the truck's movement is a prerequisite for those actions.
